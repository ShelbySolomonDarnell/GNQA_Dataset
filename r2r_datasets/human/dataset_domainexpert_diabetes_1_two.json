      "Figure 8 Molecular changes in the islets of patients with T2D mirror the processes altered in NOD mice.mRNA expression in human pancreatic islets from healthy individuals (n = 105) and those diagnosed with T2D (n = 14) was assessed through RNA-seq analysis. (a) Relationship between GLIS3 and MANF expression in healthy individuals (Spearman correlation P value = 0.043), individuals with T2D (Spearman correlation P value = 0.075) and all individuals (Spearman correlation P value = 0.028). (b-e) Expression of XRCC4 (b), LIG4 (c), H2AFX (d) and CDKN1A (e) in healthy islets as compared to i slets from patients withT2D (P values shown after multiple-testing correction).The median and interquartile range (IQR; box) are shown, with error bars indicating 1.5 times the IQR.Individual values are shown if beyond 1.5 times the IQR. (f) Relationship between H2AFX and LIG4 expression in human islets (Spearman correlation P value = 5  10 9 ).Parallel transcriptional regulation in human isletsTo determine whether the findings observed in mice were applicable to humans, we investigated whether the pathway identified in NOD mice also demonstrated genetic linkage to diabetes or glucose regulation traits in humans.GLIS3 polymorphisms have previously been associated with altered glucose regulation; we additionally identified nominally significant associations for MANF, XRCC4 and LIG4 polymorphisms (Supplementary Table 2).In an independent approach that takes into account environmental effects, we analyzed RNA-seq data from human pancreatic islets isolated from 119 donors, including 14 diagnosed with T2D 28 .To assess the validity of the Glis3-Manf relationship observed in mice, we investigated the relationship of these two genes in human islets.A trend toward reduced GLIS3 expression was observed in T2D islets, whereas MANF expression appeared unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 13).Critically, a significant positive relationship was observed between GLIS3 and MANF levels in human islets (Fig. 8a).Next, we investigated whether patients with T2D might exhibit reduced XRCC4 expression, analogous to the NOD polymorphisms.We found no change in XRCC4 expression in T2D islets (Fig. 8b); however, the levels of the obligate binding partner encoded by LIG4 were significantly reduced (Fig. 8c).In mice, Xrcc4 polymorphisms were associated with increased senescence; likewise, in patients with T2D, the levels of the senescence markers H2AFX (Fig. 8d) and CDKN1A (Fig. 8e) were increased.Finally, a direct relationship was observed between reduced LIG4 and increased H2AFX levels (Fig. 8f).Although the cause of coregulation cannot be assessed in ex vivo human islets, the parallel with NOD mice strongly supports a conservation of diabetes susceptibility mechanisms across species.3,500,000 3,000,000 2,500,000 2,000,000 1,500,000 1,000,000 500,000 0 Fluorescence",

      "One method of searching for the cause of NIDDM is via the candidate gene approach.Possible candidates for NIDDM include genes involved in specifying pancreatic islet (3-cell phenotype and in directing fj-cell development and (3-cell responses of glucose-mediated insulin synthesis and secretion.The transcription factor islet-1 (Isl-1) has been shown to be a unique protein that binds to the mini-enhancer or Far-FLAT region (nucleotide -247 to -198) of the rat insulin I gene (7).Isl-1, a protein comprised of 349 residues (38 kD), is a member of the LIM/homeodomain family of proteins, named for the first three members described: lin-11, isl-1, and mec-3 (8,9).These proteins are comprised of three putative regulatory regions, two LIM domains (cysteine-rich motifs) in the amino terminus of the protein, a homeobox domain near the middle, and a glutamine-rich transcriptional activation domain at the carboxyl end (7,9).With the use of an antibody to Isl-1, expression was shown to be restricted to a subset of endocrine cells, including islets, neurons involved in autonomic and endocrine control, and selected other tissues in the adult rat (10)(11)(12).",
      "ResultsImpairment or alteration of the insulin-signaling pathway is a commonly recognized feature of type 2 diabetes.It is therefore notable that the IS-HD gene set (Dataset S4) was not detected to be significantly transcriptionally altered by application of either hypergeometric enrichmentt test, DEA or GSEA.In particular, applying GSEA to the transcriptional profile dataset of diabetic and normal glucose-tolerant skeletal muscle described in Mootha et al. [10] did not identify a significant level of alteration in the IS-HD gene set (p  0.536), while DEA produced a comparably weak enrichment score (p  0.607).The failure to detect a significant transcriptional alteration in IS-HD may be explained by a number of factors.The enrichment results depended on the specific choice of the IS-HD gene set, and it is possible that an alternatively defined insulin-signaling gene set would be determined as significantly enriched.Additionally, expression changes in a few critical genes in IS-HD may be sufficient to substantially alter insulin signaling, and running DEA on the large IS-HD set may miss the contributions from these few genes.",

      "Second, we performed an extensive manual curation according to a previously described b-cell-targeted annotation (Kutlu et al, 2003;Ortis et al, 2010).In partial agreement with the IPA, we found these genes to fall into three broad categories: (1) genes related to b-cell dysfunction and death, (2) genes potentially facilitating the adaptation of the pancreatic islets to the altered metabolic situation in T2D and (3) genes whose role in disease pathogenesis remains to be unearthed (Figure 6B).The adaptation-related gene category contains few metabolism-associated genes (e.g., HK1, FBP2; Figure 6B, right part, Figure 7) and many more genes involved in signal transduction or encoding hormones, growth factors (e.g., EGF, FGF1, IGF2/IGF2AS; Figure 7), or transcription factors involved in important regulatory networks (for instance, FOXA2/HNF3B, PAX4 and SOX6) (Figure 6B, right part, Figure 7).In the b-cell dysfunction and death category, there were hypomethylated genes related to DNA damage and oxidative stress (e.g., GSTP1, ALDH3B1; Figure 7), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response (NIBAN, PPP2R4, CHAC1), and apoptosis (CASP10, NR4A1, MADD; Figure 6B, left part, Figure 7).Some genes of interest from the highlighted categories are depicted in Figure 7. Their annotated functions provide possible explanations of how the epigenetic dysregulation of these genes in diabetic islets is connected to T2D pathogenesis.Numerous genes that were identified by our methylation profiling approach have been functionally implicated in insulin secretion.Examination of the available literature on the function of these genes revealed three aspects of insulin secretion with which they interfere: some of these genes influence the expression of the insulin gene, like MAPK1 and SOX6, or its post-translational maturation, like PPP2R4 (cf. Figure 7 and references therein).Others can deregulate the process of insulin secretion itself (SLC25A5, Ahuja et al, 2007;RALGDS, Ljubicic et al, 2009) or influence synthesis as well as secretion (vitronectin, Kaido et al, 2006).A third group of differentially methylated genes affects (i) signalling processes in the b-cell leading to insulin secretion or (ii) glucose homeostasis in b-cells, thereby modulating insulin response upon stimulation.GRB10 (Yamamoto et al, 2008), FBP2 and HK1 (Figure 7) are examples for these genes.Additional genes found in our study have been implicated in the b-cells' capability to secrete insulin, though the mechanisms have not yet been fully established.The putative functions of these genes indicate a potential epigenetic impact on insulin secretion at multiple levels, namely signalling, expression/synthesis and secretion.",
      "In summary, we have associated mutations in the SLC29A3 gene with diabetes mellitus in humans and the insulin signaling pathway in Drosophila.The mechanistic basis of these findings remains to be determined.This is strong evidence supporting the investment of resources to further investigate the role of SLC29A3 and its orthologs in diabetes and glucose metabolism in model systems.DISCUSSIONWe have identified mutations in the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 3 protein that are associated with an inherited syndrome of insulin-dependent DM, and provide prima facie evidence that the Drosophila ortholog of this protein interacts with the insulin signaling pathway.This is the first evidence that mutations in the human SLC29A3 gene can be associated with a diabetic phenotype.",
      "These observations taken together suggest that molecules involved in innate immunity could serve as candidate genes that determine the susceptibility of sensitive strains of mice to virusinduced diabetes.Interestingly, deficiency of the Tyk2 gene results in a reduced antiviral response 24 .In addition, the human TYK2 gene was mapped to the possible type 1 diabetes susceptibility locus 25 .",
      "A recent sequencing study provides an example of detection of rare variants in type 1 diabetes.Targeted sequencing in a series of candidate coding regions resulted in IFIH1 being identified as the causal gene in a region associated with type 1 diabetes by GWA studies (58).IFIH1 encodes a cytoplasmic helicase that mediates induction of the interferon response to viral RNA.The discovery of IFIH1 as a contributor to susceptibility to type 1 diabetes has strengthened the hypothesis (70) about a mechanism of disease pathogenesis involving virusgenetic interplay and raised type 1 interferon levels as a cofactor in -cell destruction.Nonetheless, it should be recognized that a component of the missing heritability (familial aggregation) in type 1 diabetes could well be due to unrecognized intra-familial environmental factors.Disease pathogenesis.Contemporary models of pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes support the involvement of two primary dramatis personae: the immune system and the -cell.The known and newly identified genetic risk factors for type 1 diabetes present exciting opportunities to build on to the current cast of disease mechanisms and networks.Most of the listed genes of interest (Table 2) and those in extended regions are assumed to regulate immune function.Some of these genes, however, may also have roles in the -cell (insulin being the most obvious example).Another gene, PTPN2, encoding a protein tyrosine phosphatase, was identified as affecting the risk for type 1 diabetes as well as for Crohn disease (47,71).PTPN2 is expressed in immune cells, and its expression is highly regulated by cytokines.However, PTPN2 is expressed also in -cells, where it modulates interferon (IFN)- signal transduction and has been shown to regulate cytokineinduced apoptosis (72).Other candidate genes, such as NOS2A, IL1B, reactive oxygen species scavengers, and candidate genes, identified in large GWA studies of type 2 diabetes, have not been found to be significant contributors to the susceptibility of type 1 diabetes (73).",
      "Differential Expression Analyses of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Associated GenesFor the aforementioned 171 'novel' genes, we used t-test to compare ribonucleic acid expression signals in PBMCs or monocytes between type 1 diabetes mellitus patients and healthy controls.We found that 37 genes, including 21 non-HLA genes (e.g.FAM46B, OLFML3 and HIPK1), were differentially expressed between type 1 diabetes mellitus patients  and controls (Table 2).For the differential expression study, the significance level of P < 5.0E-02 was used.",
      "In this study, we have correlated the function and genotype of human islets obtained from diabetic and nondiabetic (ND) donors.We have analyzed a panel of 14 gene variants robustly associated with T2D susceptibility identified by recent genetic association studies.We have identified four genetic variants that confer reduced b-cell exocytosis and six variants that interfere with insulin granule distribution.Based on these observations, we calculate a genetic risk score for islet dysfunction leading to T2D that involves decreased docking of insulin-containing secretory granules, impaired insulin exocytosis, and reduced insulin secretion.",

      "In summary, we report AEIs that are consistent with type 2 diabetes-associated variation regulating the expression of cis-linked genes in human islets.For some of the genes where significant AEI was identified (e.g., SLC30A8, WFS1), there is strong evidence from human genetics that small changes in gene dosage may have significant consequences for the pancreatic b-cell.For other genes with significant AEI (e.g., ANPEP, HMG20A), their role is less well defined, and hence this study should provide a platform for further work examining the effects of carefully manipulating the expression of these genes in human islets.",

      "Genome-wide association studies in human type 2 diabetes (T2D) have renewed interest in the pancreatic islet as a contributor to T2D risk.Chronic low-grade inflammation resulting from obesity is a risk factor for T2D and a possible trigger of -cell failure.In this study, microarray data were collected from mouse islets after overnight treatment with cytokines at concentrations consistent with the chronic low-grade inflammation in T2D.Genes with a cytokine-induced change of 2-fold were then examined for associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and the acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg) using data from the Genetics Underlying Diabetes in Hispanics (GUARDIAN) Consortium.Significant evidence of association was found between AIRg and single nucleotide polymorphisms in Arap3 (5q31.3),F13a1 (6p25.3),Klhl6 (3q27.1),Nid1 (1q42.3),Pamr1 (11p13), Ripk2 (8q21.3),and Steap4 (7q21.12).To assess the potential relevance to islet function, mouse islets were exposed to conditions modeling low-grade inflammation, mitochondrial stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, glucotoxicity, and lipotoxicity.RT-PCR revealed that one or more forms of stress significantly altered expression levels of all genes except Arap3.Thapsigargininduced ER stress up-regulated both Pamr1 and Klhl6.Three genes confirmed microarray predictions of significant cytokine sensitivity: F13a1 was down-regulated 3.3-fold by cytokines, Ripk2 was up-regulated 1.5-to 3-fold by all stressors, and Steap4 was profoundly cytokine sensitive (167-fold up-regulation).Three genes were thus closely associated with low-grade inflammation in murine islets and also with a marker for islet function (AIRg) in a diabetes-prone human population.This islet-targeted genome-wide association scan identified several previously unrecognized candidate genes related to islet dysfunction during the development of T2D.Genome-wide association studies in human type 2 diabetes (T2D) have renewed interest in the pancreatic islet as a contributor to T2D risk.Chronic low-grade inflammation resulting from obesity is a risk factor for T2D and a possible trigger of -cell failure.In this study, microarray data were collected from mouse islets after overnight treatment with cytokines at concentrations consistent with the chronic low-grade inflammation in T2D.Genes with a cytokine-induced change of 2-fold were then examined for associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and the acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg) using data from the Genetics Underlying Diabetes in Hispanics (GUARDIAN) Consortium.Significant evidence of association was found between AIRg and single nucleotide polymorphisms in Arap3 (5q31.3),F13a1 (6p25.3),Klhl6 (3q27.1),Nid1 (1q42.3),Pamr1 (11p13), Ripk2 (8q21.3),and Steap4 (7q21.12).To assess the potential relevance to islet function, mouse islets were exposed to conditions modeling low-grade inflammation, mitochondrial stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, glucotoxicity, and lipotoxicity.RT-PCR revealed that one or more forms of stress significantly altered expression levels of all genes except Arap3.Thapsigargininduced ER stress up-regulated both Pamr1 and Klhl6.Three genes confirmed microarray predictions of significant cytokine sensitivity: F13a1 was down-regulated 3.3-fold by cytokines, Ripk2 was up-regulated 1.5-to 3-fold by all stressors, and Steap4 was profoundly cytokine sensitive (167-fold up-regulation).Three genes were thus closely associated with low-grade inflammation in murine islets and also with a marker for islet function (AIRg) in a diabetes-prone human population.This islet-targeted genome-wide association scan identified several previously unrecognized candidate genes related to islet dysfunction during the development of T2D.In conclusion, GWAS studies focusing on the causes of T2D have implicated islet dysfunction as a major contributing factor (18,71).By examining isolated islets for stress responses and cross-referencing gene hits with genes associated with glucose-stimulated insulin release in human populations with T2D, we identified 7 genes that may play a role in promoting or preventing islet decline in T2D.By further examining stress-induced expression changes in each of these genes, we identified 5 genes that stood out: F13a1 as a novel stress-inhibited gene in islets, Klhl6 and Pamr1 as induced genes specific to ER stress, Ripk2 as a  broadly stress-induced gene, and Steap4 as an exceptionally cytokine-sensitive gene.These genes provide promising leads in elucidating islet stress responses and islet dysfunction during the development of T2D.",
      "Finally, several of the linking nodes introduced into this islet network through their PPI connections represent interesting candidates for a role in T2D pathogenesis, and there are several examples where external data provides validation of those assignments.An interesting example involves the gene GINS4 which maps at the ANK1 locus.Though this gene generated a low PCS [0.03] and was not included in the set of seed genes for this locus, GINS4 knock-down has an impact in a human beta-cell line [14].In addition, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) has been shown to influence beta-cell mass in a compensatory mechanism related to age-and diet-induced stress, connecting beta-cell dysfunction and progressive beta-cell mass deterioration [54].YHWAG is a member of the 14-3-3 family, known to be signalling hubs for beta-cell survival [55], and disruption of SMAD4 drives islet hypertrophy [56]."

      "Results: Here we report on a meta-analysis approach that integrates data of heterogeneous origin in the domain of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Different data sources such as DNA microarrays and, complementing, qualitative data covering several human and mouse tissues are integrated and analyzed with a Bootstrap scoring approach in order to extract disease relevance of the genes.The purpose of the meta-analysis is two-fold: on the one hand it identifies a group of genes with overall disease relevance indicating common, tissue-independent processes related to the disease; on the other hand it identifies genes showing specific alterations with respect to a single study.Using a random sampling approach we computed a core set of 213 T2DM genes across multiple tissues in human and mouse, including well-known genes such as Pdk4, Adipoq, Scd, Pik3r1, Socs2 that monitor important hallmarks of T2DM, for example the strong relationship between obesity and insulin resistance, as well as a large fraction ( 128) of yet barely characterized novel candidate genes.Furthermore, we explored functional information and identified cellular networks associated with this core set of genes such as pathway information, protein-protein interactions and gene regulatory networks.Additionally, we set up a web interface in order to allow users to screen T2DM relevance for any -yet non-associated -gene.DiscussionThe first part of our study was devoted to the identification of genes related to T2DM using different heterogeneous data sources in different organisms.Genes have been scored in each individual study according to their disease relevance and an overall score across the different studies has been computed that reflects their total disease relevance.By this approach we were able to identify 213 genes that have a general disease relevance showing high scores in many different studies as well as genes that have a specific disease relevance expressing high scores in only a few studies.",

      "INTRODUCTIONMultiple genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have correlated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with genetic variants, yielding a large number of loci and associated gene products that are linked to the disease phenotype-often with little or no insight into the mechanism underlying that link (Hivert et al., 2014).The current challenge is to establish robust systems to systematically evaluate the role of these loci using disease-relevant cells.Previous studies have used patient samples, cell lines, or animal models to seek mechanistic insight but with significant limitations.Large variation is observed in primary patient samples, perhaps due to genetic heterogeneity, whereas animal models present major physiological and metabolic differences that hamper understanding of the precise function of human genes in T2DM.Therefore, a robust system to systematically evaluate the role of T2DM-associated genes using disease-relevant human cells will provide an important tool for diabetes research and spur the development of precision (allele-specific) therapies, exemplified by the use of sulfonylurea drugs to treat patients carrying certain KCNJ11 mutations (Gloyn et al., 2004).",

      "T2DM-GeneMiner web toolIn order to allow users to screen the disease potential of any given gene of interest we developed T2DM-GeneMiner, a web interface summarizing the results of our work (Figure 1, [35]).The user interface is shown for the wellknown Adipoq and the resulting bar plots for two other genes, Pdk4 and Cfd, with lower content of available infor-mation.The resource is searchable by gene or protein IDs (for example Ensembl ID or gene symbol).The score distribution is shown as a bar plot and, where available, functional information is displayed.The two rightmost bars show the entropy, indicating uniform or specific score distribution, and the score.The red line at the score bar indicates the cut-off.Background: Multiple functional genomics data for complex human diseases have been published and made available by researchers worldwide.The main goal of these studies is the detailed analysis of a particular aspect of the disease.Complementary, meta-analysis approaches try to extract supersets of disease genes and interaction networks by integrating and combining these individual studies using statistical approaches.Results: Here we report on a meta-analysis approach that integrates data of heterogeneous origin in the domain of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Different data sources such as DNA microarrays and, complementing, qualitative data covering several human and mouse tissues are integrated and analyzed with a Bootstrap scoring approach in order to extract disease relevance of the genes.The purpose of the meta-analysis is two-fold: on the one hand it identifies a group of genes with overall disease relevance indicating common, tissue-independent processes related to the disease; on the other hand it identifies genes showing specific alterations with respect to a single study.Using a random sampling approach we computed a core set of 213 T2DM genes across multiple tissues in human and mouse, including well-known genes such as Pdk4, Adipoq, Scd, Pik3r1, Socs2 that monitor important hallmarks of T2DM, for example the strong relationship between obesity and insulin resistance, as well as a large fraction ( 128) of yet barely characterized novel candidate genes.Furthermore, we explored functional information and identified cellular networks associated with this core set of genes such as pathway information, protein-protein interactions and gene regulatory networks.Additionally, we set up a web interface in order to allow users to screen T2DM relevance for any -yet non-associated -gene. Conclusion:In our paper we have identified a core set of 213 T2DM candidate genes by a metaanalysis of existing data sources.We have explored the relation of these genes to disease relevant information and -using enrichment analysis -we have identified biological networks on different layers of cellular information such as signaling and metabolic pathways, gene regulatory networks and protein-protein interactions.The web interface is accessible via http://t2dmgeneminer.molgen.mpg.de.",

      "This approach requires the accumulation and integration of many types of data,and also requires the use of many types of statistical tools to extract relevant patterns ofcovariation and causal relations as a function of genetics, environment, stage, and treatment. Inthis protocol we explain how to use the GeneNetwork web service, a powerful and free onlineresource for systems genetics. We provide workflows and methods to navigate massive multiscalardata sets and we explain how to use an extensive systems genetics toolkit for analysis andsynthesis.",

The tool allows users to inspect anyregion of the human genome to find candidate genes related to a genetic disease orphenotype defined in OMIM. It does this by identifying GO terms that match MESHterms for an OMIM record.",
      "Researchers, however, have thepossibility to fully explore the results by altering the thresholds on the open web resource. Although onlyprotein-coding genes were included in our analysis, the same approach can be applied to non-coding genes63to reveal their potential functions. Similarly, GeneBridge can also be utilized to identify novel gene-diseaseassociations based on known disease-associated genes from databases, such as the Human DiseaseOntology (DO) [207] or DisGeNET [208]. The GeneBridge toolkit could also be applied to large-scaleproteomics datasets after correcting for the background of all measured proteins.",

      "Users begin by selecting one or more human diseases andclicking on Compare. The genes associated with the selected diseaseare tested for enrichment against all sets of known associated genes forworm phenotypes. The result reveals functionally coherent, evolutionarily conserved gene networks. Alternatively, users can also start by selecting worm phenotypes,which are tested against human diseases. In addition to cross-speciestesting, results of within-species disease enrichment are also available(e.g. to nd the closest related human disease for another input humandisease).",

      "We next constructed protein-protein interaction networks.To do this, we selected 76 genes known from monogenic forms of diabetes, obesity, and hypertension or GWAS hits (type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension) for which the lead association lies within the protein-coding part of the gene (Table S3).",
      "First, we describe the construction of a functional network for human genes.This network spans 87% of validated protein coding genes, and provides strong predictive power for a majority of currently known genetic diseases.We evaluate six alternate approaches for prioritizing candidate disease genes using this network, and demonstrate the strongest overall performance with algorithms related to Google's PageRank.We then show that this network, in conjunction with genome-wide association data for Type 2 diabetes and Crohn's disease, boosts the identification of disease-associated genes that were discovered in later meta-analyses.This work suggests both a specific strategy and a general path to future improvements for the interpretation of GWAS data.Taken together, our work demonstrates that a high-quality functional network for human genes can provide a powerful resource for identifying causal genes in human disease.A new functional gene network for human genesIn order to test the general ability of a gene network to prioritize disease genes, particularly in conjunction with GWAS studies, we constructed a genome-scale functional network of human genes, incorporating diverse expression, protein interaction, genetic interaction, sequence, literature, and comparative genomics data, including both data collected directly from human genes, as well as that from orthologous genes of yeast, worm, and fly.The resulting HumanNet gene network can be accessed through a web interface (http://www.functionalnet.org/humannet).Using this interface, researchers can easily search the network using a set of ''seed'' Network-guided genome-wide association mining genes of interest.The interface returns a list of genes ranked according to their connections to the seed genes, together with the evidence used to identify each coupling.The interactions and evidence can be downloaded, and a network visualization tool has been incorporated.All linkages can also be downloaded for independent analysis.",

      "GeneNetwork.org also offers a powerful statistical platform foronline network analyses and mapping, enabling numerous molecular questions to be probed in one centralized location(Chesler et al. , 2003, 2005; Li et al. , 2010; Mulligan et al. , 2012,2017, 2019). Most data are from groups of animals or humanswho have been fully genotyped or even sequenced.
