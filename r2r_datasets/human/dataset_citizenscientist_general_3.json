    "The traits are determined by the combination of chromosomes from the sperm and egg during fertilization. Each parent contributes one set of 23 chromosomes, which include both dominant and recessive genes. These genes interact with each other and the environment, and sometimes by chance, to determine the traits of the offspring. The process of meiosis and recombination, or crossing over, also plays a crucial role in shuffling genetic material and creating genetic variation.",
    "Genetic tracing is both matrilineal and patrilineal. Matrilineal tracing is done through mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is passed from mother to all her children without any contribution from the father. Patrilineal tracing, on the other hand, is done through Y-DNA, which is passed from father to son. Both types of tracing provide different insights into an individual's ancestry.",

      "Selection could occur at multiple levels, from germ cell generation and propagation to fertilization and early embryonic growth.Chromosomal abnormalities, including aneuploidy, were found in 10-20% of spermatozoa and oocytes (20) and in the cleaved embryo, with a 21% rate of abnormalities in preimplantation embryos (21).These findings led to a model for natural selection against chromosome abnormalities (21).Selection extends to the end of gestation: Only approximately 30% of all conceptions result in a live birth, with more than half of aborted fetuses containing chromosomal abnormalities (22), a number likely to be an underestimate because of technological limitations in measuring all possible mutations.But even in the very small fraction of germ cell duos that survive this withering genome attack and result in a live birth, a number of severe de novo mutations will still be found (23).The data on gross chromosomal alterations suggest that overall, mutation frequency early in life is very high.The functional consequence, however, is limited because of selection.Somewhat surprisingly, this picture points toward an initial decline in genomic alterations, allowing the adult individual to acquire a somatic genome optimally equipped to provide function.",

      "Crossing over-The swapping of genetic material that occurs in the germline.During the formation of egg and sperm cells, also known as meiosis, paired chromosomes from each parent align so that similar DNA sequences from the paired chromosomes cross over one another.Crossing over results in a shuffling of genetic material and is an important cause of the genetic variation seen among offspring.This process is also known as meiotic recombination.The reason for the rarity of these mutations is natural selection: If the mutations result in disorders that decrease health and reproductive fitness, they will eventually be eliminated from a population.In exceptional cases, mutations may cause both beneficial and detrimental consequences, resulting in opposing forces of positive selection and negative selection that may cause the mutations to be preserved at nonrare frequencies in a population.For example, the HbS mutation in the HBB gene (which produces the  subunit of hemoglobin) causes sickle cell disease when present in both alleles, a detrimental consequence, but protects against malaria when present in 1 allele, a beneficial consequence, ensuring that the mutation persists in populations in areas of the world where malaria is endemic.Genes are passed from parents to offspring via the process of meiosis by which gametes, the egg cells in the mother and the sperm cells in the father, are generated.Ordinarily, each cell has 23 pairs of chromosomes; the gametes have 23 unpaired chromosomes.In meiosis, the 23 pairs are split so that each gamete receives 1 chromosome from each pair (Figures 8 and 9).Two gametes (egg and sperm) ultimately join into a single cell, the zygote, which has the full complement of 23 chromosome pairs restored.If all goes well, the zygote gives rise to a live offspring.Recombination (meiotic recombination)-The swapping of genetic material that occurs in the germline.During the formation of egg and sperm cells, also known as meiosis, paired chromosomes from each parent align so that similar DNA sequences from the paired chromosomes recombine with one another.Recombination results in a shuffling of genetic material and is an important cause of the genetic variation seen among offspring.Also known as crossing over.",
      "In the generation of gametes, crossing over regularly occurs, and genetic information is swapped between members of a chromosome pair.That doesn't matter within inbred animals, because the swapped parts are identical.In an F 1 animal, however, the chromosomes of a particular pair are genetically different, one each having come from each parent.Each gamete produced will be unique, as will be each F 2 zygote formed by uniting of the gametes from two F 1 parents.An F 2 group thus provides for expression of some genetic variability.This variability is limited to the allelic differences existing between the parent strains of the F 1 s, so that another F 2 , derived from different inbred strains, will express different genetic differences.",

      "Traditionally, it has been agreed that thenal sex of an individual (phenotypic sex)depends on two sequential processes: the sexdetermination system of the species and thegonad differentiation process (Valenzuela,2008). However, recently, these two seeminglydistinct processes are viewed as part of a general process leading to gonad formation andsex ratios (Sarre et al. , 2004; Quinn et al. , 2011;Uller and Helantera, 2011).However, we expect thatonly at this level, the most signicant contributions brought by integrating epigenetics will bemade. Concluding Remarks and FutureProspectsFish sex ratios are the result of a complex interaction between genetic, biochemical, and environmental interactions. The ultimate resultof these interactions at the individual level isgender: male or female. However, at the population level, the combination of sex determination and differentiation sets the sex ratio. Inturn, sex ratios dene the reproductive capacityof populations and, if sex growth dimorphismexists, also the growth characteristics, something very important in an aquaculture context.The inheritance of sex based on major sexfactors, also known as chromosomal sex determination, includes monofactorial and multifactorial SD mechanisms, with the presence of aFunctional Genomic Analysis of Sex Determination and Differentiation in Teleost Fish(A)ZygoteSex determinationEmbryosSex differentiationLarvaeJuvenilesSex changeAdultsTime(B)Majorsex factorsMinorsex factorsMonofactorialaPolyfactorialdbcEnvironmentalEnvironmentaldifferencesFigure 8.2 Sex determination and differentiationin sh.

      "Because of the small contribution, through the sperm, ofthe paternal transcriptome to the fertilized zygote, and because of the stronger maternal contributionto child rearing in most model organisms, parental effects are typically thought of as synonymous withmaternal effects, although true paternal effects are known to exist (Rando, 2012). Maternal effects have been shown to be important during embryonic development, leading todifferences in the birth weight of mice depending on the genotype of the mother (Cowley et al. ,1989; Wolf et al. , 2011).Therefore, the resulting phenotypic patterns lag a generationbehind the genetic transmission of the causal variants. The most well-studied parental genetic effectsare caused by deposition of maternal transcripts into the egg prior to fertilization, resulting indifferences in early embryonic development depending on the genotype of the mother. Certain geneshave also been shown to respond to maternal influence after birth through genetically definedmaternal behaviors (Weaver et al. , 2004).",

Maternal effects canaccount for a large proportion of phenotypic variance, especiallyduring early life, and for some traits explain more variation thandirect genetic effects [33, 97, 99, 100, 102115]. However, maternal and offspring genotype are correlated (i.e. half their genes areshared), and in inbred lines they are fully confounded, thus separating the effects of their respective genotypes is difficult. To removethis confounding effect cross-fostering has been used, both in thelaboratory and in the field [119, 131].",

      "Although autosomal SNPs are commonly used as genetic markers to infer ancestry or race/ethnicity membership, haploid such as mitochondria, Y-DNA, and X-lined markers are also important to provide separate stories of ancestry of individuals from paternal and maternal sides [42,43].Therefore, genetic structure created due to autosomal markers could be different from those of lineage markers (often influenced by political, social, and migration history of individuals/populations).mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA haploid is the maternally inherited mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) [44].All children inherit mtDNA from their mother, with no admixture from the father.Like Y-line DNA, mtDNA is passed intact from one generation to the next but through maternal line.a) Autosomal DNA (testing both sexes) markers: autosomal DNA tests utilize DNA from the 22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes.Autosomal DNA is inherited from both parents.Autosomal testing provides percentages of ethnicity using autosomal DNA SNP test (i.e., ancestry informative markers), and it is the most commonly used test to infer ancestry across diploid genome.b) Y-DNA or Y-SNPs (paternal line testing) markers: a haploid Y-DNA is the paternally inherited non-recombining portion of the Y chromosome, and it tests only for males.The Y-DNA testing tests the Y chromosome which is passed intact from father to son with no DNA from the mother.Y-DNA testing can then be used to trace direct paternal line.Y-DNA remains the same in each generation, allowing us to compare surname from different regions to see if we are from the same family.Y-line testing does not indicate anything about the contributions of the other ancestors in a family tree.In other words, you could be 3/4th Native American, with only the direct paternal line being European, and this test would tell you nothing at all about those other three Native lines.When testing the Y-chromosome, there are two types of tests, short tandem repeat (STR) and SNP markers.STR tests are best for recent ancestry while SNP tests tell about more ancient ancestry.c) Mitochondrial DNA (maternal line testing) markers:",
      "Additional information about past breeding practices can be gleaned by quantifying the number of reproductive males and females in a population.This can be achieved by comparing levels of genetic diversity between sex chromosomes, autosomes and mtDNA 99 .In cattle, for example, gene flow from aurochs is evident in the autosomes but is absent in mtDNA 41 .This has been interpreted as a management strategy that may have involved allowing insemination of domesticated females by wild bulls 41,100 .In horses, a comparison of the levels of diversity of the Y chromosome and the autosomal chromosomes demonstrated that some cultures allowed fewer males to breed and instead selected specific stallion bloodlines 55 .This male-oriented breeding strategy was not practised by the Romans and only became increasingly prominent in the past 1,000 years as a result of the growing influence of Oriental stallions (Arabian, Persian and Turkmen) 101 .",
      "Dr Ring: What makes the maternal gene so peculiar compared to the paternal?Dr Cookson: If you look in the epidemiologic sense, many studies show that there is increased risk of allergic disease if the mother is affected.However, very few studies have actually set out to test that formally and most of them might suffer from some sort of selection bias because the mother is more likely to be aware of her symptoms and feel guilty, and so on.It is very difficult to explain.Is it genomic imprinting, where the gene is only active when transmitted through the mother?I do not think all of these genes would be imprinted, though it is possible.It also seems that there are effects of the maternal phenotype.The maternal phenotype, if the mother is affected or unaffected, determines the strength of the maternal effect.Again, if a gene was imprinted, you would not expect maternal phenotype to be important.So, I think that this has something to do with maternal/fetal interaction, either through the placenta or shortly after birth.There is the issue of immune conflict between mother and child.At the same time, the mother is trying to prime the infant's immune system.",

      "There are also a number of companies that utilize ancestry informative markers (AIMs) and claim that they can provide accurate determinations of a person's ancestry.The problem with these services is their assumption that for all populations reliable genetic markers of high ancestry informative value exist.There is also a second assumption that the frequency of these markers has not changed through time.This may be true for persons of european descent, in areas that have not seen large population disruptions.however, it is doubtful that a reliable genetic marker panel can be produced for German or Lithuanian Jews, just as such a panel for Western or Central African regions that were impacted by the slave trade is less likely.To understand this sophistication requires training in evolutionary and population genetics.Unfortunately, many of the scientists working with these companies do not have adequate background in these disciplines.In general, American universities are not providing the majority of biology students training in these disciplines.Marocco (2000) reported that only 46 percent of the phD-granting public universities and 15 percent of the phD-granting private universities required evolution as a core course.Genetics is widely required as a core at the undergraduate level, but the topics of population and quantitative genetics are at the back of the major texts and the genetics courses are usually taught by molecular geneticists.Neither is evolution well covered in anthropology texts (White et al. 2009. )White and colleagues' ( 2009) study showed that these texts did not give a single accurate definition when the topic was present.Additionally, the definitions often changed when books were written for cultural versus physical anthropology and often changed within the same text.This means that even at the undergraduate level, the tools required to critically approach molecular reductionist thinking are not widely provided to students.Graduate curricula tend to be narrower than undergraduate training.Thus, the vast majority of scientists who go into human genetics, bioinformatics, computational biology, and genomics are not well prepared to address the complex interactions that account for the phenotypes we observe in modern societies.",

      "Although bilateral descent is the norm in Western societies, it is not universal and there is variation with cultural practices around lineage.In certain societies, individuals place greater importance on (and have greater knowledge about) one side of the family than another (unilineal descent).Thus, individuals in patrilineal groups trace relationships through males only so that your father's brother's children are members of your family, but not your father's sisters (Kottak, 2007).They are members of their husband's group or family.Efforts to create a family pedigree may be hampered if the participant is not familiar with her mother's relatives, but her mother's brother's children (her cousins) may be able to supplement her overall family history.Knowledge about the cultural system of unilineal descent avoids assuming the universality of bilateral descent.Cultural beliefs such as these also have implications in the conduct of genetic research in terms of confidentiality and autonomy (Benkendorf et al., 1997;Wertz, 1997).One cannot assume that the named proband is in a position to speak for the extended family in agreeing to participate in any genetic research (DudokdeWit et al., 1997).",

The levels of complexityobserved here (e.g. 14 loci explaining 70% of the genetic variance for 4-NQO resistance) arestill dramatically lower than those seen in for some human traits in GWAS (e.g. 40 lociexplaining 5% of the variance for height 2,5). One obvious explanation is the difference inexperimental designs (line crosses vs. population association studies), but differences ingenetic architectures among species and traits may also contribute.",
      "The method uses two pieces of information: mapping data from crosses thatinvolve more than two inbred strains and sequence variants in the progenitor strains within the intervalcontaining a quantitative trait locus (QTL). By testing whether the strain distribution pattern in the progenitor strains is consistent with the observed genetic effect of the QTL we can assign a probability that anysequence variant is a quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN). It is not necessary to genotype the animals exceptat a skeleton of markers; the genotypes at all other polymorphisms are estimated by a multipoint analysis.",

      "Genotyping all the individual progeny formarkers that show allelic variation between the parental strains (either single nucleotide polymorphisms or simple sequence repeats) will allow the detection of associations between trait values and marker genotype, and in this way demonstrate to whichset of markers a QTL is linked. To reduce the genotyping effort, selective genotypingof the individuals at the extremes of the phenotypic spectrum can be performed (20,23). Although these three approaches are in general considered to be the best to detect andmap QTL, they have several disadvantages for quantitative traits involving HSC.",
      "So, how do you go about planning and performing a QTL study, and howdo you identify the responsible gene within a QTL that you have identified? Generally, one starts by performing a strain survey to find two parental inbredstrains that have a markedly different trait. One can now look up many differenttraits of inbred mice online at the Mouse Phenome Database (http://phenome. jax.org/pub-cgi/phenome/mpdcgi?rtn=docs/home). However, the trait you maywant to study may not be present in wild type mice, so you may want to crossa mutant (or genetically engineered) strain onto several inbred strains.QTL Theory and PlanningThe theory behind the most basic form of QTL mapping is based upon intercrossing two inbred strains. The mouse genome consists of 19 pairs of autosomes (non sex-determining chromosome) and the X and Y chromosomes. Inthe example shown in Fig. 18.1, we are intercrossing stain A (shown with ablack chromosome pair) with strain B (shown with a white chromosome pair). The initial F1 (filial generation 1) mice are true hybrids, with each individualFrom: Molecular Biomethods Handbook, 2nd Edition.",
      "These candidate genes are then sequenced in the two parental inbredstrains looking for sequence dierences in coding or regulatory regions. After ne mapping the QTL interval and shortening the list of plausiblecandidate polymorphisms, the major challenge remains \u0001 proving denitivelywhich nucleotide polymorphism underlies the QTL. The most direct proofwould be replacing one strains allele with another strains allele (creating aFIG. 1. Intercross breeding strategy for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs). On the right, the parental, F1 hybrid, and intercross (F2) mousegenerations are depicted.",
      "QTL mapping studies thenseek to detect the polymorphisms underlying the complex traits of interest byscanning for alleles that co-vary withthe traits. Similar experiments also can be conducted with special derivatives of inbredstrains known as recombinant inbred(RI) mice. These animals are derivedby cross-breeding two or more distinctparental strains (which often divergewidely for the trait of interest), followedby inbreeding of the offspring for severalgenerations (Bailey 1971). Given thecorrect breeding strategy, this method1This is an issue faced by GWASs researchers when classifyingsamples as cases or controls."
