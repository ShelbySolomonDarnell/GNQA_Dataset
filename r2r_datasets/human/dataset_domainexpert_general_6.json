  "answer": [
    "Genetic regulation is not only done through DNA elements like promoters, repressors, and activators. It also involves other components such as transcription factors, which are proteins that control the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA. Additionally, non-coding RNAs, which do not code for proteins, play a significant role in gene regulation. There are also epigenetic factors, which influence gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. These include chemical modifications to the DNA or proteins associated with it. So, genetic regulation is a complex process involving multiple elements and layers of control.",
    "The relationships between traits can be described by four basic models: one-to-one, where one gene gives rise to one trait; one-to-many, where one gene affects many traits (pleiotropy); many-to-one, where many genes affect one trait (polygeny); and many-to-many, where multiple genes interact to influence multiple traits. Additionally, traits can also be related through genetic correlation, where the directions of effect are consistently aligned. Furthermore, traits can be interconnected through complex developmental processes and environmental interactions.",
    "Yes, the landscape of QTL and GWAS hits can be used to find relationships between traits. This is done by mapping genome regions to variation in a large number of traits, thereby inferring biological relationships between those traits and connecting them into networks. This approach can help identify the genetic basis of variation in complex traits."

At the highest level, regulatory units interact to create a particulargene circuit, e.g. , two gene-promoter pairs can be arranged in amutually inhibitory network to create a genetic toggle switch. Ateach of these levels, one can identify sequence representationsthat define certain aspects of regulation and control, as well ascompositional relationships (e.g. , spatial arrangement and orientation) and interactions between biomolecules, molecular components, and/or sub-components that impact functional outputsand behaviors.",
      "These regulatory programs are apparent across a variety of jointcontributions, from the independent contribution of each of the regulatory mechanisms to acooperative contribution of several mechanisms. A regulatory program may include a varietyof mechanisms such as transcription factors, chromatin remodeling complexes, and promoterregulatory elements. Natural genetic variations may provide important insights into regulatory programs. Inparticular, transcription profiles can be integrated with genotypic data across a population toidentify genomic loci that have an effect on gene expression (Mackay et al. , 2009), and hence itis possible to use these loci as potential regulatory mechanisms.",

      "INTRODUCTIONThe field of gene regulation is currently undergoing a renaissance.With the successful annotation of most of the protein-coding portion of the human genome [1], the focus of much research has shifted toward deciphering the regulatory logic governing the temporal, spatial and quantitative aspects of gene expression that is embedded in the remaining 98% of DNA that does not encode for protein [2].A flurry of papers stemming, in large part, from two broad areas of investigation has recently made a significant impact on the field of gene regulation.The first revolves around the genetic basis of human disease.Fueled by the power of linkage and genome-wide association studies, an ever-expanding list of human diseases has been associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) residing in noncoding regions of the genome [3].These disease-associated SNPs are thought to directly control some aspect of target gene expression, or are linked to other DNA variants that possess regulatory activity.In a small but growing number of cases, the regulatory SNPs identified in human genetic studies have led to the identification of disease susceptibility loci and have served as useful entry points for unraveling the complexities of the gene regulatory landscape (Table 1) [3].The second line of investigation that has revitalized gene expression research relates to the development of functional genomic approaches to screen noncoding DNA for regulatory potential.Genome-wide surveys of sequence conservation [4][5][6], histone modifications [7][8], DNAse I hypersensitivity [9] and DNA structure [10], have all significantly improved the detection of functional cis-acting regulatory sequences.This review will highlight recent examples from the literature that have successfully integrated genetic and genomic approaches to uncover the molecular basis by which cis-regulatory mutations alter gene expression and contribute to human disease.",
      "Complexity of gene regulationGene regulation is a complex multi-layered process involving numerous proteins and non-coding RNAs which may act at a great distance from their target gene.Elaborate multi-protein/RNA complexes must be assembled at the site of regulation.The regulatory mechanism may be intricate and variable, potentially involving transcript rearrangement and mRNA degradation.It is now clear that RNA has a diverse set of functions and is more than just a messenger between gene and protein.The mammalian genome is extensively transcribed, giving rise to thousands of RNA transcripts that are never translated into proteins.Whether all of these transcripts are functional is currently debatable, but it is evident that these include families of RNA molecules with a regulatory function [34].The presence of a gene expression change, which is strongly correlated with relevant physiological changes, in the absence of proximate significant GWAS signals, suggests that relatively distant regulatory variants (and potentially many such variants) may act in combination to regulate the expression of the target gene of interest.Such putative gene expression-modulating variants could potentially act upon target gene expression through the mediation of non-protein-coding regulatory RNAs.For example, recent studies have shown that the expression of many genes is modulated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and micro-RNAs, e.g.reviews by [10,30], which do not encode proteins.In addition to microRNAs, many nonprotein-coding RNA species (or \"RNA genes\"), such as long noncoding RNAs [42], are transcribed from the genome.Thus, there is compelling evidence that most of the genome may be transcribed [5,6,9,19,38,53,58,59,62] and the potential role of non-protein coding RNA genes in the modulation of protein-coding gene expression remains to be fully evaluated.",
      "Transcription factors that bind to DNA recognize this sequence and use it to correctly position RNA polymerase, the enzyme that actually generates the transcript.Other sequences, called enhancers and repressors, speed up and slow down, respectively, the rate of transcription.Enhancer and repressor sequences can be quite distant from the gene's coding region.Other transcription factors recognize these sequences and further control how much and how fast mRNA is generated.All of these sequences are part of a gene and are required to generate the many proteins that control the overall maintenance and general metabolism of all of our cells.Genes that are expressed in all cell types, such as RNA polymerase and transcription factors, are called housekeeping genes.Concepts in the 21st Century: Genetic and Epigenetic Regulation of Gene ExpressionWe now know that only about 1% of our genome encodes proteins.Alternative splicing is the primary mechanism by which our approximately 20,000 genes can code for hundreds of thousands of proteins.Alternative splicing refers to modification of the primary mRNA produced during transcription (Figure 8).Only a portion of the transcript contains sequences that are translated into a protein.Introns, or intervening sequences, are removed after transcription, and the remaining sequences, known as exons, are spliced together.One transcript can be processed in multiple ways, such that different combinations of exons can be spliced together, producing many different proteins from the same primary transcript.The discovery of alternative splicing has changed our thinking about the central dogma because we now know that the concept of one gene encoding one protein is not true.",
      "Of the total 20,000-25,000 protein-coding genes, occupying only 1.2% of the human genome, about six percent are functionally classified as TFs [8].However, some 93% of our genome is transcribed, by far the greatest part expressed as non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNA), including the miR-NAs [9].An order of magnitude more numerous than all the proteins which make up living organisms are the transcrip-*Address correspondence to this author at the School of Medicine, University of Louisville, 580 S.

Mattick, who suggests that the genome may consist largely of massively embedded RNA coding sequences directing regulatory networks, which may have co-evolved with proteins.These two complementary genomic sets may ultimately form the interacting RNAprotein regulatory networks which control the complex layers of signaling communication within all cells [11,12].Thus, the intriguing notion of epigenomic regulation of essential processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, etc., characterized by feed-forward RNA regulatory networks, is becoming increasingly important in our appreciation of the epigenetic information required for the development of multi-cellular organisms [11].In this report, we focus our discussion on the suggestion that derailment of the RNA-protein interaction, and its subsequent impact on the regulatory networks which they direct, may constitute a significant fraction of the molecular mechanisms controlling the aging process.",

      "REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSIONApart from the protein coding sequences, there are other biologically relevant nucleic acid sequences that play other important roles in the genome such as regulation of gene expression and maintenance of the chromatin structure (Pique-Regis et al., 2011).Regulation of gene expression involves a process that leads to increase or decrease in the production of specific proteins (Jacob and Monod, 1961).It is an important aspect of the cell because it increases the versatility and adaptability of an organism by allowing the cell to produce proteins only when they are needed (Payankaulam, 2010;Jacob and Monod, 1961).Gene expression is regulated at the level of transcription (described in 2.8), which can only occur if transcription factors bind to the DNA.Binding occurs within special nucleotide sequences called regulatory regions that are usually several hundred base pairs long (Lodish et al., 2000).Regulatory regions surround transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes apart from some sequences called enhancers that are located far upstream or downstream of their target gene (Birney et al., 2007;Dineen et al., 2007).",

      "As outlined by Lewontin (2011), the relationship between genotype and phenotype can be described by four basic models that have been, and still are, used in genetics: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many (see Fig. 1).The first goes back to the unit factor theory at the beginning of the twentieth century, i.e., one gene gives rise to one trait (Mayr 1982).The second model describes one gene affecting many traits (pleiotropy), while the third model accounts for many genes affecting one trait (polygeny).It is undoubtedly correct that every part of the genome is connected causally with the phenome (a set of phenotypes) by at least some molecular mechanistic pathways, but there is variation in this relation, which can make all of these four models valid at least for some cases.But generally for most eukaryotic organisms, model 4 (many-to-many) is the most acceptable description for most cases of the relationship between phenotype and genotype (Lewontin 2011).And often, the many-to-many model is insufficient, since genes and environment are usually both involved in the development of phenotypes, as captured by the norm-of-reaction concept (see, e.g., Falk 2001).",

      "However, common practice in genetics treats this relationshipas a straightforward one-to-one mapping from genotype to phenotype. The roots of this practicecan be traced to Mendel who chose traits with a direct relationship between genetic variation andphenotypic variation in formulating his particulate theory of inheritance. It has been furthersolidified by the successes of modern genetics in identifying genes involved in many simpleWtraits, such as rare human diseases. However, most traits are not simple and to understandcomplex traits it is necessary to decipher the developmental processes that occur between genesIEand traits.It was believed by many that for each trait variant we should expect to find acorresponding genetic change, or gene for that trait. Through historical happenstance therelationship between genes and traits was set up and treated as if it were one-to-one. But theproduction of a trait involves not only genes, but also their interactions with each other and theenvironment, and chance.Two approaches to understanding the genotype-phenotype relationship are describedand examples given of how both lead to a many-to-many relationship. First, cellular and geneticmechanisms, such as alternative splicing, DNA and chromatin modification, cellular gene choice,and gene regulation, which lead from DNA sequence to protein structure, are discussed.

We exploited theeasy access to tissue, which is a critical advantage of model organisms, to map eQTLs.Theseexamples illustrate the utility of combining GWAS with eQTL data to identify the molecularmechanism by which a chromosomal region influences a complex trait. DiscussionWe performed a GWAS in a commercially available outbred mouse population, which identifiednumerous physiological, behavioral, and expression QTLs. In several cases the implicated loci weresmaller than 1 Mb and contained just a handful of genes that included an obvious candidate. Inaddition, we used the eQTL results to further parse among the genes in the intervals that wereimplicated in the behavioral traits.",
      "The remarkable success in mappinggenes linked to a number of disease traits using genomewide association studies (GWAS) in human cohorts hasrenewed interest in applying this same technique in modelorganisms such as inbred laboratory mice (Su et al. 2010). Unlike classical phenotypic traits, gene expression traitsgiving rise to cis-acting eQTL provide us with a prioriknowledge of the true QTL location (Doss et al. 2005),which can be used to empirically estimate the power of aGWAS performed at a similar scale (Hao et al. 2008;Schadt et al. 2008).",
      "Genomic regions linked to complex traits can be identified by genetic mappingand quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis (Shehzad and Okuno 2014). 7QTL mappingQTL mapping with molecular markers is the first strategy in genetic studies. In plantbreeding, QTL mapping is an essential step required for marker-assisted selection(Mohan et al. 1997; Shehzad and Okuno 2014). The fundamental idea underlying QTLanalysis is to associate genotype and phenotype in a population exhibiting a geneticvariation (Broman and Sen 2009).",
      "QTL mapping studies thenseek to detect the polymorphisms underlying the complex traits of interest byscanning for alleles that co-vary withthe traits. Similar experiments also can be conducted with special derivatives of inbredstrains known as recombinant inbred(RI) mice. These animals are derivedby cross-breeding two or more distinctparental strains (which often divergewidely for the trait of interest), followedby inbreeding of the offspring for severalgenerations (Bailey 1971). Given thecorrect breeding strategy, this method1This is an issue faced by GWASs researchers when classifyingsamples as cases or controls.The investigatorsfirst identified all QTLs associated witha classical phenotype and then winnowed the list of potentially associatedgene-expression traits on the basis oftheir correlation or eQTL overlap withthe phenotype of interest. Candidategenes then were ranked by applyingthe LCMS technique, which uses theeQTL data to establish causal relationships between DNA loci and transcripts as well as between transcriptsand phenotypes and finally identifiesa model that best fits the data."
