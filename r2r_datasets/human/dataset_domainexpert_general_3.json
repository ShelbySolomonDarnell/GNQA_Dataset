    "The text suggests using online bioinformatics resources such as Ensembl, UCSC Human Genome Browser, and others for research and data analysis. It doesn't specifically mention adding books or web resources to a system, but refers to utilizing these online tools and databases for information retrieval and bioinformatic analysis.",
    "Ensembl is a joint project between the EBI and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute that provides a database for genome data. Launched in 1999, it was the first to provide a window on the draft genome, curating the results of computational analyses. It contains automatically annotated genomes and integrates data from a wide range of biological research sources. Ensembl also provides tools for data retrieval and analysis, and it includes quality checks for genetic variants in its variation pipeline.",
    "QTL mapping is a statistical method used to identify regions in the genome that correlate with variation in a phenotype. It has high power, meaning it can detect a QTL, but it does not precisely identify which of the many genes within the QTL is causal. On the other hand, GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies) is a method used to identify genetic variants associated with complex traits. It has low power, requiring large numbers of individuals, but it has high precision, often identifying smaller candidate regions.",
    "To determine which gene in your QTL is causal for the trait, you can start by narrowing down the list of candidate genes within the QTL. This can be done by performing a strain survey, using genetically engineered mice to alter the expression of a candidate gene, or using comparative genomics to narrow down the QTL to a region containing only a few genes. You can then investigate whether the expression of these genes correlates with the phenotype(s) of interest. If a variant within a gene causes a change in its expression, and the expression of that gene correlates with expression of a phenotypic trait of interest, it is considered a good candidate. Network analyses can also be used to build up more evidence for which gene is causal. Finally, you can confirm the candidate genes by complementation of a QTL, which can be achieved in several ways, including transgenic complementation.",
    "Actually, males have one Y chromosome and one X chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. This combination determines the sex of an individual."

(i) It is a larger web resource than T1Dbase and integrates data from a wide range of biological research sources into its database.Therefore, available information is quite comprehensive. (ii) Genic positions for 99% of the variants obtained from T1Dbase could be retrieved. (iii) Ensembl contains quality checks for genetic variants in its variation pipeline.A variant is flagged as failed if certain quality criteria are not met, for instance if none of the variant alleles match the reference allele of the variant.Generally, Ensembl was found to give more detailed information regarding the genic positions of variants compared to T1Dbase.Information about genes, including gene names, chromosomal coordinates, biotype (coding or non-coding), and number of splice variants, can also be retrieved from Ensembl.",

      "Quantitative trait locus-mapping is a statistical methodused to map chromosomal intervals (loci) that contribute toheritable variance in phenotypes. The method simply compares the inheritance of allelic variants (B or D genotypesin our case) with differences in phenotypes. A QTL willgenerally cover a region that includes 10100 genes, andthese positional candidates can then be ranked roughly onthe basis of criteria such as the types of DNA variants, patterns of mRNA expression, data from complementary humangenetic cohorts (GWAS and linkage) and relevant literatureabout gene effects on central nervous system structure andfunction.",
      "These approaches were used to identify dozens of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for BMD and other bone traits [15,16]. However, identifying causative genes underlying QTL proved challenging [17]. Over the last decade, genemapping approaches have transitioned from low-resolution linkage mapping to high-resolution GWASs [11]. The first GWASs in mice used panels of inbred mouse strains [1821] andby leveraging accumulated recombinations, this approach significantly increased mapping resolution [19].",
      "The process of QTL mapping includes phenotyping andgenotyping at least several hundred animals from an informative mapping population (e.g. , B6D2 F2). Once a QTL isdetected and confirmed, additional work is needed to identify the specific gene(s) in the QTL interval responsible forthe phenotypic variation. An elegant way to improve QTLmapping resolution is through the development and testingof interval-specific congenic strains (Darvasi, 1997). Thismethod has been successfully used to fine map an ethanolwithdrawal QTL on mouse chromosome 4 (Fehr et al. ,2002; Shirley et al. , 2004).",

QTL mapping was done in several stages to identify loci acting individually and QTL thatinteracted, either additively or epistatically. To determine individually-acting QTL, a singleQTL genome scan was conducted with the function scanone.",

The levels of complexityobserved here (e.g. 14 loci explaining 70% of the genetic variance for 4-NQO resistance) arestill dramatically lower than those seen in for some human traits in GWAS (e.g. 40 lociexplaining 5% of the variance for height 2,5). One obvious explanation is the difference inexperimental designs (line crosses vs. population association studies), but differences ingenetic architectures among species and traits may also contribute.",
      "Forward genetics approaches that combine traditional QTLmapping with expression quantitative trait mapping (eQTL; in which case transcript abundance is the quantitative trait) [32] are increasingly being used to successfully transition fromQTL to QTG [3335]. Traditional QTL analysis will identify the genomic regions affectingtrait variation, while eQTL analysis can help in understanding which genes, pathways, and biological processes are also under the influence of a given QTL.",
      "On the onehand, the genomic location that are in suspicion to be involved in the trait can still involvelarge genomic segments, e.g. , millions of basepairs that include many genes within the segment. On the other hand, GWAS may point toseveral or even many genomic locations for thetrait of interest, complicating further functionalanalysis. Analysis of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL)QTL analysis reveals statistically signicantlinkage between phenotypes and genotypes,thereby providing explanation for the geneticbasis of variation in complex traits (Falconerand Mackay, 1996; Lynch and Walsh, 1998).",

TDMs can be integrated withGenotyping by Sequencing (GBS) approaches to anchor geneticmaps to physical maps (Poland et al. , 2012; Sonah et al. , 2013).

Unlike classical phenotypic traits, gene expression traitsgiving rise to cis-acting eQTL provide us with a prioriknowledge of the true QTL location (Doss et al. 2005),which can be used to empirically estimate the power of aGWAS performed at a similar scale (Hao et al. 2008;Schadt et al. 2008).",
      "QTLmapping has been highly successful in determining causative loci underlying severaldisease phenotypes (Wang et al. 2004; Cervino et al. 2005; Abboud and Kaplowitz 2007)and can broadly be subdivided into two classes: linkage mapping and association mapping. For standard linkage mapping in experimental crosses, likelihood or regression approachesare used to map QTL, with flanking markers used to infer genotypes in the intervalsbetween widely spaced markers (i.e. > 1cM) (Lander and Botstein 1989; Haley and Knott1992).38Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping has been used to associate a specificgenotype with the variation in a single measured phenotype like high density lipoproteins(Wang and Paigen 2005) and ethanol tolerance (Grisel et al. 2002). At each locus in asegregating population, a model is fit which estimates the likelihood that this locus explainsthe variation in phenotype versus the likelihood that there is no genotypic effect on thephenotype.

Similar experiments also can be conducted with special derivatives of inbredstrains known as recombinant inbred(RI) mice. These animals are derivedby cross-breeding two or more distinctparental strains (which often divergewidely for the trait of interest), followedby inbreeding of the offspring for severalgenerations (Bailey 1971).

      "Prior belief or knowledge about the number of true causal and trueindependent links that might be expected in a typical QTL, depending on the studydesign, should be considered to safeguard against high false-positive rates (lowpositive predictive values). In studies that involve mapping gene expression (eQTL),protein (pQTL) or metabolite (mQTL) traits, information about co-localization ofQTL and genes that are functionally linked to the trait provides information aboutthe likelihood of causal links.",
      "The next step is to investigate whether the expression of these genes correlates with the phenotype(s) of interest.This would suggest a chain of causality: a variant within a gene causes a change in its expression, and the expression of that gene correlates with expression of a phenotypic trait of interest.To do this, we created a correlation matrix between all genes within a QTL with a cis-eQTL in any brain tissue as well as the phenotypes that contributed to the QTL (Supplementary Table S6).Any gene with a cis-eQTL and a significantly correlated expression was considered a good candidate.If the gene only had a cis-eQTL and correlation in a single brain region, then it suggested that this brain region might also be of interest for the phenotype (adding another link to this chain).",
      "One possible approach to facilitate this endeavor is to identify quantitative trait loci(QTL) that contribute to the phenotype and consequently unravel the candidategenes within these loci. Each proposed candidate locus contains multiple genes and,therefore, further analysis is required to choose plausible candidate genes. One ofsuch methods is to use comparative genomics in order to narrow down the QTL to aregion containing only a few genes. We illustrate this strategy by applying it togenetic findings regarding physical activity (PA) in mice and human.",

This step is daunting because more thanone gene may be involved and the function of some geneswithin the interval may be unknown. Until recently, thisstep emphasized the detection of polymorphisms withincoding sequence (reviewed in Korstanje and Paigen, 2002and Glazier et al. 2002); for a polymorphism that producesan amino acid substitution, one can often infer and thentest for a functional consequence.",
      "To understand the genetic networks that underliequantitative variation in the trait, it is also very important todiscover genes whose expression is correlated with the traitafter accounting for the known effects of the QTL on thetrait. Many of these genes may have expression that isassociated with QTL genotype, and would therefore beidentified as important via the tests described above. Othergenes, however, may have expression values that are correlated with the trait but unassociated with genotype at theQTL.Theapproach is motivated by the fact that a research project isoften focused on a specific classical quantitative trait. If amajor QTL for this classical trait has been identified, it isoften desirable to test whether this QTL is also associatedwith the transcription level of any genes, which will provide clues as to which genes belong to the pathway that theQTL uses to modulate the classical trait.",

      "So, how do you go about planning and performing a QTL study, and howdo you identify the responsible gene within a QTL that you have identified? Generally, one starts by performing a strain survey to find two parental inbredstrains that have a markedly different trait. One can now look up many differenttraits of inbred mice online at the Mouse Phenome Database (http://phenome. jax.org/pub-cgi/phenome/mpdcgi?rtn=docs/home).

The evidence required forsuch confirmation has engendered much discussion (ComplexTrait Consortium 2003; Glazier et al. 2002) and is likely to varydepending on the nature of the trait and specific resourcesavailable to pin down underlying genes (e.g. availability ofknock-in or knock-outs, specific antibodies, siRNA, etc.).

      "Given such a high abundance of young male-biased genes, we asked whether their parental genes are also male-biased.We found that fewer parental genes of X-linked male-biased duplicates were also male-biased (20%, 2/10) compared to the parental genes of autosomal young male-biased duplicates (32%, 12/37).These data, despite the small sample sizes and being statistically not significant, may suggest that compared to autosomal young genes, X-linked young genes more often evolved novel male-biased expression.However, as the majority of young genes are the result of intrachromosomal duplication events, the pattern might also reflect the fact that X-linked old genes are less likely to be male-biased.A slight excess of X-linked female-biased genes was also detected (Fig. 2).Although most of them are old, a few recently arose on the X chromosome over 4 to 6 Myr in the common ancestor of the D. melanogaster and D. simulans clade (branch 5).This can be interpreted in the context of the dominance model of the sexual antagonism hypothesis.In this case, a dominant, X-linked gene that is favorable to females but disadvantageous for males can become fixed.The slow accumulation of female-biased genes in the X reflects an overall low rate of female gene origination, either due to a small dominance effect (the degree of dominance h!1/2), or a minor disadvantageous effect on males (the ratio of fitness effects of male relative to female k!0) along with a favorable effect on females (Vicoso and Charlesworth 2006, Equation 10).Regarding the second step in the evolution of male-biased genes, namely X!A transposition, sexual antagonism favorable for autosomal fixation (Vicoso and Charlesworth 2006) and/or MSCI (Lifschytz and Lindsley 1972;Betran et al. 2002) may play a role in this process.On the other hand, the within-chromosomal duplication rate is higher than the between-chromosomal duplication rate (Emerson et al. 2008), which may contribute to the slow pace of X!A transposition.It has been observed that male-biased genes in Drosophila are overrepresented on autosomes (Parisi et al. 2003;Ranz et al. 2003).Consistent with this result, a dynamic process that can explain the nonrandom autosomal distribution has also been observed, in which autosomal new genes with X-linked parental genes are often male-biased.Specifically, a significant excess of autosomal testisexpressed retrogenes were identified as RNA-duplicates of X-linked parental genes (Betran et al. 2002).Recently, similar X!A gene traffic was observed in the DNA-level duplication and relocation data set of the Drosophila genus (Vibranovski et al. 2009b), and was further confirmed for DNA-level duplications in the D. pseudoobscura neo-X chromosome (Meisel et al. 2009).In addition, selective extinction of neo-X linked male-biased genes also occurred in D. pseudoobscura (Sturgill et al. 2007).These three lines of genome-wide investigation support a common pattern of outof-X traffic for male-biased genes, resulting in an enrichment of these genes on autosomes in the long term.It has been reported that the initial manifestations of new gene emergence, namely polymorphic duplicates, occur at a lower frequency on the X chromosome, thus indicating that these duplicates are subject to stronger purifying selection (Emerson et al. 2008).Therefore, the excessive fixation of X-linked duplicates might not occur via neutral processes.Positive selection could have facilitated the fixation of X-linked young genes in addition to driving their subsequent sequence evolution.",
      "Occasionally, Y chromosome DNA is detected in the maternal plasma, and the fetus appears to have female genitalia on sonographic examination.The underlying mechanisms for this include a twin demise, a maternal disorder of sexual differentiation, such as Swyer syndrome, or that the mother has undergone a bone marrow or solid organ transplant from a male donor (Bianchi, 2018;Hartwig, Ambye, Sorensen, & Jorgensen, 2017).",

      "When meiosis takes place, a pair of chromosomes may fail to separate properly, creating a sperm or egg that has either two copies or no copy of a specific chromosome.This is a sporadic event and it is called nondisjunction.Nondisjunction can lead to an extra chromosome, called trisomy, or a missing chromosome, called monosomy (GHR, 2008l).Down syndrome is an example of trisomy.Individuals who have Down syndrome have an extra chromosome number 21. Turner syndrome is an example of monosomy.Girls who have Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome.This causes them to have short stature and be infertile (NHGRI, 2008l).X-Linked InheritanceX-linked genetic disorders (also called sex-linked) are caused by gene mutations on the X chromosome.Most often X-linked genetic disorders are seen in males.Males inherit the X chromosome from their mother and the Y chromosome from their father.Because males have only one X chromosome, if they inherit a gene mutation on the X chromosome from their mother, they will have the disorder.Examples of X-linked genetic disorders occurring in males include hemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (GHR, 2008o)."
