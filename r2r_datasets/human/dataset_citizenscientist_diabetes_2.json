    "There are primarily four types of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2, gestational diabetes, and diabetes due to specific causes. However, there are also subtypes within these broad categories, such as latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) and maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY).",
    "Yes, there is a direct association between aging and susceptibility to having diabetes. The risk of onset of type 2 diabetes increases with age, and most diabetic patients in certain regions are 40 years old or more. Additionally, aging is associated with changes in body composition and glucose tolerance, which can contribute to the development of diabetes.",
    "Genetics plays a significant role in the emergence of diabetes. Certain forms of the disease result from mutations in a single gene, while others are multifactorial in origin. For example, monogenic forms of diabetes, which account for approximately 5% of cases, are caused by mutations in genes encoding insulin, the insulin receptor, and other factors. In type 1 diabetes, gene variants in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus and about 50 other genes contribute to the genetic risk. These genes modulate immune regulation, viral responses, and responses to environmental signals. Genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes is also determined by genes related to immune function. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are polygenic diseases where many common variants contribute to overall disease risk.",
    "The genes associated with diabetes include PPARG, KCNJ11, TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKN2A, IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, IRS1, CCR5, FTO, NOTCH2, WFS1, JAZF1, ADIPOQ, AHSG, CAPN10, ENPP1, PPARGC1A, SREBF1, PDX1, PFAS, GCK, GIGYF1, HNF1A, TNRC6B, and G6PC2.",
    "Diabetes is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. This includes a family history of diabetes, increased age, hypertension, lack of physical exercise, obesity, and certain dietary habits. In type 2 diabetes, the body develops resistance to insulin due to the malfunction of insulin-producing -cells. Some cases of diabetes are also linked to single gene defects. Additionally, exposure to certain environmental pollutants has been associated with the development of diabetes."

      "The prevalence of diabetes mellitus worldwide is sobering; the International Diabetes Federation estimates that 415 million people have diabetes mellitus, with 90% of these individuals having type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 1 .T2DM occurs when pancreatic -cells fail to release enough insulin to meet the demands of insulin-responsive tissues, which safely store and metabolize glucose.Driven by both genetic and environmental risk factors, T2DM is a complex, multifactorial disorder.Although the increasing prevalence of T2DM is driven by changes in our environment and mirrors the increase in obesity, the greater concordance for T2DM found in monozygotic compared with dizygotic twins has long provided evidence for a genetic component in T2DM risk 2 .",
      "In the UK alone, nearly 1.8 million people are already recognized to have this disorder (consuming w5% of the total National Health Service budget), and the search is on to find the 'missing million' who are living with the condition but in whom the diagnosis has yet to be made. 3In the USA, the situation appears to be even more serious with some commentators predicting that one in every three Americans born in the year 2000 will go on to develop diabetes during their lifetime, bringing unprecedented costs in terms of healthcare dollars as well as human morbidity and mortality. 4The majority (w90%) of these cases will be type 2 in origin, reflecting a trend towards obesity and more sedentary lifestyles as the 'norm' rather than the exception in 'developed' societies.Indeed, the face of T2DM is changing, as a condition that was once considered the preserve of middle/old age is increasingly diagnosed in young adults and even children, reflecting the high rates of obesity (and, in particular, visceral adiposity) in these populations.",
      "Table 1 lists the various subtypes of diabetes based on the classification suggested by the ADA [4].The ADA lists four subtypes of diabetes based on the clinical symptoms at time of presentation, [4] namely, Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes (T2D), gestational diabetes, and diabetes due to specific causes (genetic defects causing deficient insulin secretion or action, diseases of pancreas, use of certain drugs such as steroids, thiazides among others).Of these, T2D is the most prevalent (close to 90% of all cases) and is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing nations [1].At times it is difficult to assign a patient to a particular subtype due to the difference in conditions associated with hyperglycemia at the time of diagnosis [4,7].For example, a lady diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus during pregnancy is highly susceptible to develop T2D later.Therefore, other than proper treatment during and post pregnancy, a regular follow-up is required for stratifying disease risk, and for timely management before progression to another subtype.It is clear that the classification of diabetes may not be as simple as just categorizing it into any one of the four given subtypes due to its miscellaneous nature.Every case needs to be considered at the time of presentation, on the basis of the risk factors or underlying cause of hyperglycemia, the clinical symptoms, and disease prognosis.",
      "IntroductionGlobally, diabetes affects more than 400 million people (World Health Organization, 2016), with Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes (T1D) accounting for up to 10 percent of cases (American Diabetes Association, 2009).In the United States, T1D occurs at a rate of 15-30 cases per 100,000 children aged 0-14 years annually (International Diabetes Foundation, 2017;Maahs et al., 2010), with similar prevalence in Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand (Fig. 1) (Derraik et al., 2012;International Diabetes Foundation, 2017;Maahs et al., 2010).By contrast, the estimated incidence rate of T1D among Asians, South Americans, and Africans is below 15 cases per 100,000 children (Fig. 1) (International Diabetes Foundation, 2017;Maahs et al., 2010).The global incidence of T1D has been rising by 3-5% per annum over the past two decades, with a notable increase in children below 10 years of age (Diamond Project, 2006;Patterson et al., 2009).",
      "Animal Models9.2% in women and 9.8% in men, with approximately 347 million people suffering from the disease worldwide in 2008 (Danaei et al., 2011).There are several different classifications of diabetes, the most common being type 1 and type 2 diabetes.Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes with prevalence in the United Kingdom of around 4%.It is most commonly diagnosed in middle-aged adults, although more recently the age of onset is decreasing with increasing levels of obesity (Pinhas-Hamiel and Zeitler, 2005).Indeed, although development of the disease shows high hereditability, the risk increases proportionally with body mass index (Lehtovirta et al., 2010).Type 2 diabetes is associated with insulin resistance, and a lack of appropriate compensation by the beta cells leads to a relative insulin deficiency.Insulin resistance can be improved by weight reduction and exercise (Solomon et al., 2008).If lifestyle intervention fails, there are a variety of drugs available to treat type 2 diabetes (Krentz et al., 2008), which can be divided into five main classes: drugs that stimulate insulin production from the beta cells (e.g.sulphonylureas), drugs that reduce hepatic glucose production (e.g.biguanides), drugs that delay carbohydrate uptake in the gut (e.g.a-glucosidase inhibitors), drugs that improve insulin action (e.g.thiazolidinediones) or drugs targeting the GLP-1 axis (e.g.GLP-1 receptor agonists or DPP-4 inhibitors).",
      "IntroductionDiabetes impacts the lives of approximately 200 million people worldwide [1], with chronic complications including accelerated development of cardiovascular disease.Over 90% of cases are of type 2 diabetes (T2D), with the bulk of the remainder presenting with type 1 diabetes (T1D).",
      "Classification of DiabetesOn the basis of insulin deficiency, diabetes can be classified into the following types as follows.",
      "| INTRODUCTIONToday, more than 265 million people are affected across the world.It is estimated that by the year 2030 this number will reach 366 million people (about 4/4 percent of the world's population), and now the cause of death is more than 1.1 million per year (including 50% of the population under-70 years of age and 55% of women).On the other hand, given its negative effect on the economic growth of developing countries, it calls for universal mobilization to combat this disease (Bhattacharya, Dey, & Roy, 2007).Diabetes or diabetes mellitus is referred to as a heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism disorders that result from a defect in the secretion of insulin, or impairment in its function, or both.Types of diabetes mellitus include type 1, type 2 diabetes and other kind of diabetes, but the two most common types of diabetes mellitus are type 1 and type 2, which are different in several aspects (Meshkani, Taghikhani, Mosapour et al., 2007).Type 1 diabetes has been identified with autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells (insulin secreting cells) and accounts for about 5% of all diabetic people, while type 2 diabetes is a predominant disorder characterized by insulin resistance or a relative decline in insulin production, and accounts for about 90% of all types of diabetes mellitus (Meshkani, Taghikhani, Al-Kateb et al., 2007).Important factors that predispose a person to type 2 diabetes are multifactorial, including genetic factors and environments.However, its inheritance has certainly not been proven, but it is believed that first-degree relatives of diabetic patients have a higher chance to develop the disease.In this regard, recognizing gene polymorphisms of this disease seems to be necessary (Hring et al., 2014).Multiple genes have been studied in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.",
      "CONCLUSIONSDiabetes is currently broadly classified as type 1, type 2, gestational, and a group of \"other specific syndromes. \"However, increasing evidence suggests that there are populations of individuals within these broad categories that have subtypes of disease with a well-defined etiology that may be clinically characterized (e.g., LADA, MODY).These developments suggest that perhaps, with more focused research in critical areas, we are approaching a point where it would be possible to categorize diabetes in a more precise manner that can inform individual treatment decisions.Type 2 DiabetesIn the U.S., an estimated 95% of the nearly 30 million people living with diabetes have type 2 diabetes.An additional 86 million have prediabetes, putting them at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes (9).Among the demographic associations for type 2 diabetes are older age, race/ ethnicity, male sex, and socioeconomic status (9).Type 1 DiabetesBetween 2001 and 2009, there was a 21% increase in the number of youth with type 1 diabetes in the U.S. (7).Its prevalence is increasing at a rate of ;3% per year globally (8).Though diagnosis of type 1 diabetes frequently occurs in childhood, 84% of people living with type 1 diabetes are adults (9).Type 1 diabetes affects males and females equally (10) and decreases life expectancy by an estimated 13 years (11).An estimated 5-15% of adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes actually have type 1 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) (12).",
      "Background Diabetes is presently classified into two main forms, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but type 2 diabetes in particular is highly heterogeneous.A refined classification could provide a powerful tool to individualise treatment regimens and identify individuals with increased risk of complications at diagnosis.",
      "Diabetes mellitus now affects ~8% of the world's adult population [1], including ~3 000 000 individuals in the UK (with a further 600 000 people affected but presently undiagnosed) [2].Of these cases, > 90% have Type 2 diabetes.Treatments of the complications of the disease, which range from stroke, blindness and kidney failure to lower limb amputations and cancer, presently consume ~10% of the National Health Service budget, some 14 bn per year [3].These figures are anticipated to increase further in the next 10 years, driven by increasingly sedentary lifestyles and increases in obesity; the collision between these 'environmental' factors and genetic susceptibility (see below) being the key underlying driver.Whilst existing treatments ameliorate the symptoms of the disease, notably hyperglyca-emia, none target the underlying molecular aetiology.In particular, no available treatments tackle the progressive and largely irreversible loss of insulin production [4] which, in the face of insulin resistance, underlies the progressive deterioration in glucose control.Reductions in b-cell mass [5,6] and dysfunction [7] both contribute to this gradual impairment in insulin release.Recent years have seen an increase in the view that the former may play a less important role than the latter, with a 2008 study by Rahier et al. [6] reporting that b-cell mass (and insulin content) in people with Type 2 diabetes was on average ~35% lower than that of healthy control subjects.However, this difference was only ~24% within 5 years of diagnosis, far below levels likely to lead to the symptoms of diabetes.Indeed, given our present inability to monitor b-cell mass prospectively over the course of the disease, it is conceivable that the differences observed post mortem between healthy individuals and those with Type 2 diabetes [5,6] may reflect an increased predisposition to diabetes in those born with a lower than average b-cell mass.",
      "INTRODUCTIONType 2 diabetes (T2D) affects an estimated 425 million people worldwide, a number predicted to rise to 629 million by 2045 (1).The disease usually involves insulin resistance but is ultimately the result of pancreatic b cell failure, a sine qua non for disease development (2).In contrast, Type 1 diabetes (T1D) affects a smaller proportion of people with diabetes and is chiefly the result of pancreatic b cell destruction mediated by immune cells (3).",
      "IntroductionDiabetes is a complex and heterogeneous disease with a staggering global impact and the most recent estimates indicate 346 million people worldwide suffer from this disease (WHO Diabetes Fact sheet No. 312, 2011).Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for >90% of cases, and occurs when peripheral tissue insulin resistance accompanies insufficient b-cell insulin production.While >80% of diabetes deaths occur in low-and middle-income countries [1].India and China have the highest reported prevalence of diabetes with 65 and 98 million in 2013, respectively [2].",
      "The disease burden related to diabetes is high and rising in every country, fuelled by the global rise in the prevalence of obesity and unhealthy lifestyles.The latest estimates show a global prevalence of 382 million people with diabetes in 2013, expected to rise to 592 million by 2035.The aetiological classification of diabetes has now been widely accepted.Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the two main types, with type 2 diabetes accounting for the majority (>85%) of total diabetes prevalence.Both forms of diabetes can lead to multisystem complications of microvascular endpoints, including retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy, and macrovascular endpoints including ischaemic heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease.The premature morbidity, mortality, reduced life expectancy and financial and other costs of diabetes make it an important public health condition.The disease burden related to diabetes is high and rising in every country, fuelled by the global rise in the prevalence of obesity and unhealthy lifestyles.The latest estimates show a global prevalence of 382 million people with diabetes in 2013, expected to rise to 592 million by 2035.The aetiological classification of diabetes has now been widely accepted.Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the two main types, with type 2 diabetes accounting for the majority (>85%) of total diabetes prevalence.Both forms of diabetes can lead to multisystem complications of microvascular endpoints, including retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy, and macrovascular endpoints including ischaemic heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease.The premature morbidity, mortality, reduced life expectancy and financial and other costs of diabetes make it an important public health condition.",
      "Introduction: Is Type 2 Diabetes a Genetic Disorder?According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 350 million people worldwide have diabetes, and this disorder is likely to be the seventh leading cause of death in 2030.Diabetes is an economic burden on healthcare systems, especially in developing countries (World Health Organization, 2013)."

      "Our result provides a novel hypothesis on the mechanism for the connection between two aging-related diseases: Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes.",
      "There are two major factors that underlie these alarming projections.The first is T2D is associated with age, and Western populations are aging rapidly.The second major explanation is our lifestyles have changed dramatically in recent years.Epidemiological studies have identified strong T2D risk relationships for obesity, sedentary behavior [2][3][4], and diets rich in energy [5], processed carbohydrates [6], and animal fats [7].Collectively, these lifestyle factors impede the actions of insulin and raise hepatic glucose production, which can result in the diminution of endogenous insulin production and T2D.The strongest evidence for a causal relationship between adverse lifestyle behaviors and T2D comes from randomized controlled trials that show intensive lifestyle interventions involving structured exercise regimes which promote habitual physical activity (PA) and have a major beneficial impact on diabetes incidence in high-risk individuals [8,9].Epidemiological studies examining the associations between lifestyle behaviors and diabetes risk have reached similar conclusions as the clinical trials described above.For example, the 14-year follow-up University of Pennsylvania Alumni Health Study [52] (n = 5,990 men aged 39-68 years) showed PA (leisure time physical activity [LTPA] expressed in kcal expended per week through walking, stair climbing, and sports) was inversely associated with the incidence of T2D.Incidence rates declined as energy expenditure rose from 500 through 3,500 kcal/week.The age-adjusted relative risk ratio (RR) of T2D was reduced by about 6% for each 500 kcal increment increase in PA energy expenditure.",
      "Overall, results were similar in analyses restricted to diabetes mellitus identified at baseline only, although the confidence interval included 1.These results suggest that diabetes mellitus is related to risk of AD in old age.These findings are consistent with the results of 2 large longitudinal cohort studies. 5,6In one study, 5 diabetes mellitus doubled the risk of AD during 2 years of follow-up in a sample of more than 6000 older persons from a defined cohort.The other study, 6 using data from about 2500 Japanese American men, found a similar result: diabetes mellitus approximately doubled the risk of AD.In contrast, 2 other longitudinal studies 7,8 did not  demonstrate a significant association between diabetes mellitus and incident AD, but in both, the results were in the direction of increased risk.Some, [9][10][11] but not all, 12 previous studies found that diabetes mellitus was related to change in cognitive function.One factor that may contribute to variability from study to study is that diabetes mellitus may be related to decline in some cognitive systems but not others.4][15] Although diabetes mellitus was related to level of global cognition and multiple cognitive domains at baseline, we found that diabetes mellitus was only related to decline in perceptual speed.The one study 12 that did not find a relation between diabetes mellitus and cognitive decline did not include a measure of perceptual speed.COMMENTIn a cohort of more than 800 older persons, we found that diabetes mellitus sometime in the study was associated with an increased risk of developing AD during a mean of 5.5 years of observation.The risk of incident AD was 65% higher in those with diabetes mellitus than in those without it.In summary, these findings suggest that diabetes mellitus is associated with AD and decline in cognitive function in older persons.December 12, 2003.DIABETES MELLITUS AND RISK OF ADDuring the follow-up evaluations, 151 persons developed AD, of whom 31 had diabetes mellitus.In a proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, and educational level, there was a 65% increase in the risk of developing AD in those with diabetes mellitus compared with those without diabetes mellitus (hazard ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.47).The cumulative hazard of AD over time, adjusted for age, sex, and educational level, is shown graphically in Figure 1 for typical participants with and without diabetes mellitus.Similar results were found in analyses with diabetes mellitus identified at baseline only (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-2.45).",
      "Age. Age is another factor that has a considerable effect on outcomes in obesity and T2DM research.In humans, body weight increases with age and peaks at ~55 years in both men and women.Ageing per se is associated with a redistribution of both the fat-free mass and the fat mass, with the latter increase starting at ~30 years of age 129 .Intramuscular and intrahepatic fat are particularly increased in older persons, and this increase has been linked to insulin resistance 130 .Partially on the basis of these changes, ageing has been proposed to be an independent determinant of glucose tolerance, which progressively worsens with age 131,132 .",
      "Age also plays a vital role in the onset of diabetes (Cowie & Eberhardt, 1995).In south-east Asia almost 97% diabetic patients are 40 years old or more (IDF Atlas, 2017).In Bangladesh, the reported age of diabetes is 40 years in 71% urban and 85% rural female, while in the case of male the proportion is 85.5% urban and 86.5% in rural population (IDF Atlas, 2017).The current study also pinpointed an exponential increase in the risk of onset of T2DM with the increase of age when 40 years was chosen as the reference (Table S4).Whether age and stress variables are risk factors for type 2 diabetes incidence was assessed by multivariate logistic regression (Table S4).Subjects in the age groups of (40-60) and >60 years had 1.78 (p = .005)and 3.19 (p = .006)greater risk for type 2 diabetes respectively than group of <40 years.Overall, patients under stressful condition are more likely to develop T2DM than that of nonstressed respondent (p = .000).Moreover, when stress is divided into two groups-low stress and high stress, we found that both males (p = .000)and females (p = .000)with high stress were at high risk of diabetes mellitus, whereas the association between low stress and T2DM incidence was significant only among males (Male: p = .002;Female: p = .115).The distribution and association of the genotypes, age, and stress with T2DM have been summarized in Table 3 and Figure 3.There was no difference in T2DM incidence between CT (p = .030)and TT/CC (p = .034)genotype containing people who were in age group of 40-60 years (Table 3).In contrast, people who were more than 60 years old with CT genotype (OR = 4.636, p = .029)were more prone to T2DM than that of TT/CC genotype (OR = 3.714, p = .007)subjects (Table 3).",
      "Research GapsThere is a clear correlation of environmental influences to diabetes risk.Yet, the assembled experts agreed that hypothesis-driven research is needed to define direct causal relationships between specific environmental factors and pathophysiologies leading to diabetes.Research efforts need to address environmental etiologies of type 1 diabetes and determine their relative contribution to onset of autoimmunity and progression to symptomatic disease.Whether there is a direct causal role of the intestinal microbiota in pathogenesis of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and response to therapies needs to be determined.Public health interventions that successfully reduce the levels of consumption of energy-dense foods and/or reduce sedentary time and increase time spent in physical activity need to be evaluated to determine whether they can reduce type 2 diabetes incidence at a population level.",
      "In sum, it is clear that multiple risk factors are involved in diabetes-associated cognitive decrements as well as in dementia in relation to diabetes 38 .On the basis of our assessment of the literature, it is also clear that there are still substantial knowledge gaps on how the risk factors interconnect, how the risk factors translate to potentially modifiable mechanisms and which genetic factors are involved.",
      "The aim of this study was to investigate the association between age at natural menopause and risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and to assess whether this association is independent of potential intermediate risk factors for type 2 diabetes.Furthermore, we examined the role of endogenous sex hormone levels in the association between age at natural menopause and type 2 diabetes.Aims/hypothesis In this study, we aimed to examine the association between age at natural menopause and risk of type 2 diabetes, and to assess whether this association is independent of potential mediators.Methods We included 3639 postmenopausal women from the prospective, population-based Rotterdam Study.Age at natural menopause was self-reported retrospectively and was treated as a continuous variable and in categories (premature,  <40 years; early, 40-44 years; normal, 45-55 years; and late  menopause, >55 years [reference]).Type 2 diabetes events were diagnosed on the basis of medical records and glucose measurements from Rotterdam Study visits.HRs and 95% CIs were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for confounding factors; in another model, they were additionally adjusted for potential mediators, including obesity, C-reactive protein, glucose and insulin, as well as for levels of total oestradiol and androgens.Aims/hypothesis In this study, we aimed to examine the association between age at natural menopause and risk of type 2 diabetes, and to assess whether this association is independent of potential mediators.Methods We included 3639 postmenopausal women from the prospective, population-based Rotterdam Study.Age at natural menopause was self-reported retrospectively and was treated as a continuous variable and in categories (premature,  <40 years; early, 40-44 years; normal, 45-55 years; and late  menopause, >55 years [reference]).Type 2 diabetes events were diagnosed on the basis of medical records and glucose measurements from Rotterdam Study visits.HRs and 95% CIs were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for confounding factors; in another model, they were additionally adjusted for potential mediators, including obesity, C-reactive protein, glucose and insulin, as well as for levels of total oestradiol and androgens.Results During a median follow-up of 9.2 years, we identified 348 individuals with incident type 2 diabetes.After adjustment for confounders, HRs for type 2 diabetes were 3.7 (95% CI 1.8, 7.5), 2.4 (95% CI 1.3, 4.3) and 1.60 (95% CI 1.0, 2.8) for women with premature, early and normal menopause, respectively, relative to those with late menopause (ptrend <0.001).The HR for type 2 diabetes per 1 year older at menopause was 0.96 (95% CI 0.94, 0.98).Further adjustment for BMI, glycaemic traits, metabolic risk factors, C-reactive protein, endogenous sex hormone levels or shared genetic factors did not affect this association.Conclusions/interpretation Early onset of natural menopause is an independent marker for type 2 diabetes in postmenopausal women.association and explore whether the timing of natural menopause can add value to diabetes prediction and prevention.",
      "Although drawing of definitive conclusions is difficult from these observational studies, their results suggest that young-onset type 2 diabetes is associated with a much more frequent occurrence of adverse macrovascular and microvascular outcomes and a more rapidly progressing severity of complications than is seen in type 1 diabetes or later-onset type 2 diabetes.In a study of the age-specific incidence of type 2 diabetes in the UK (a retrospective cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes between 1990 and 2010), the investigators reported a substantial increase in the proportion of people aged 40 years or younger at diagnosisThe prevalence of type 2 diabetes in adolescents and young adults is dramatically increasing.Similar to older-onset type 2 diabetes, the major predisposing risk factors are obesity, family history, and sedentary lifestyle.Onset of diabetes at a younger age (defined here as up to age 40 years) is associated with longer disease exposure and increased risk for chronic complications.Young-onset type 2 diabetes also affects more individuals of working age, accentuating the adverse societal effects of the disease.Furthermore, evidence is accumulating that young-onset type 2 diabetes has a more aggressive disease phenotype, leading to premature development of complications, with adverse effects on quality of life and unfavourable effects on long-term outcomes, raising the possibility of a future public health catastrophe.In this Review, we describe the epidemiology and existing knowledge regarding pathophysiology, risk factors, complications, and management of type 2 diabetes in adolescents and young adults.",

      "A. Genetic ScreeningWe have discussed above the genetic component of T1D.The genetic susceptibility to T1D is determined by genes related to immune function with the potential exception of the insulin gene (434).The genetic susceptibility component of T1D allows some targeting of primary preventive care to family members of diagnosed T1D patients, but there is no complete inheritance of the disease.Nevertheless, the risk for developing T1D compared with people with no family history is 10 -15 times greater.Although 70% of individuals with T1D carry defined risk-associated genotypes at the HLA locus, only 3-7% of the carriers of such genetic risk markers develop diabetes (3).II. THE GENETICS OF TYPE 1 DIABETESA comprehensive overview of genetic data in mouse and human is beyond the scope of this article.Instead, we will focus on how the various susceptibility genes and environmental triggers can fit in a mechanistic model for T1D etiology.",
      "If an environmental contributor is near ubiquitous and the geneticpredisposition common as well, interventions are most sensibly weighted towardsenvironmental risk factor modification. Even here, though, there is room for further research, since the etiopathogenesisof type 2 diabetes may not be as well understood as some suggest. Specifically,Chaufan implies that dietary intervention to prevent prenatal programmingleading to susceptibility to develop type 2 diabetes (the fetal origins of adult onsetdisease hypothesis) is as evidence-based as dietary management of the adult diabetic state. However, many questions remain in this area.",
      "In 1976, the noted human geneticist James Neel titled a book chapter \"Diabetes Mellitus: A Geneticist's Nightmare.\" 1 Over the past 30 years, however, the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of diabetes has been painstakingly teased apart to reveal a family of disorders that are all characterized by the disruption of glucose homeostasis but that have fundamentally different causes.Recently, the availability of detailed information on the structure and variation of the human genome and of new high-throughput techniques for exploiting these data has geneticists dreaming of unraveling the genetic complexity that underlies these disorders.This review focuses on type 1 diabetes mellitus and includes an update on recent progress in understanding genetic factors that contribute to the disease and how this information may contribute to new approaches for prediction and therapeutic intervention.Type 1 diabetes becomes clinically apparent after a preclinical period of varying length, during which autoimmune destruction reduces the mass of beta cells in the pancreatic islets to a level at which blood glucose levels can no longer be maintained in a physiologic range.The disease has two subtypes: 1A, which includes the common, immune-mediated forms of the disease; and 1B, which includes nonimmune forms.In this review, we focus on subtype 1A, which for simplicity will be referred to as type 1 diabetes.Although there are rare monogenic, immune-mediated forms of type 1 diabetes, 2,3 the common form is thought to be determined by the actions, and possible interactions, of multiple genetic and environmental factors.The concordance for type 1 diabetes in monozygotic twins is less than 100%, and although type 1 diabetes aggregates in some families, it does not segregate with any clear mode of inheritance. 4-7Despite these complexities, knowledge of genetic factors that modify the risk of type 1 diabetes offers the potential for improved prediction, stratification of patients according to risk, and selection of possible therapeutic targets.As germ-line factors, genetic risk variants are present and amenable to study at all times -before, during, and after the development of diabetes.Thus, genetic information can serve as a potential predictive tool and provide insights into pathogenetic factors occurring during the preclinical phase of the disease, when preventive measures might be applied. Gene tic S t udiesBecause of the uncertainty regarding the number and action of genes involved in type 1 diabetes, genetic studies have tended to focus on approaches that require few assumptions about the underlying model of disease risk.The two primary approaches have been linkage studies (using pairs of affected relatives, typically siblings) and association studies (using either case-control or family-based designs).Linkage studies using affected sibling pairs seek to identify regions of the genome that are shared",
      "EnvironmentThe second factor in Figure 1 is environmental aspects.An important concept is the diabetes genotype typically causes only a predisposition for glucose intolerance (note the terminology susceptibility gene was used in the preceding paragraphs).Whether one develops the diabetes phenotype depends on environmental factors, some obvious in how they act, others less so.For instance, the Nurses Health Survey showed positive associations between obesity and lack of physical activity in the development of type 2 diabetes (as expected), but also protection by not smoking and moderate alcohol intake (14).Already discussed, many studies have shown an association between TV watching, high calorie diets, and lack of physical activity with risk of diabetes, i.e., our modern lifestyle, so it is not surprising that there is an explosion in the incidence of diabetes worldwide.",
      "The genetics of type 1 diabetesThere is a strong genetic risk to T1D.This is exemplified by (Redondo et al., 2001) who demonstrated a strong concordance of genetic inheritance (65%) and T1D susceptibility in monozygotic twin pairs.That is, when one sibling is afflicted, there is a high probability that the other twin will develop T1D by the age of 60 years.Additionally, autoantibody positivity and islet destruction was observed after a prospective long-term follow-up of monozygotic twins of patients with T1D, despite initial disease-discordance among the twins (Redondo et al., 2008).",
      "Type 1 diabetes is a genetic diseaseFamily studies have indicated that genetic factors are important determinants of type 1 diabetes risk.First, the risk to a sibling of an affected individual is approximately 6%, as compared with an average risk of 0.4% (depending on the population), or a relative increased risk of 15-fold (17).The increased risk to siblings is referred to as l s (18) and is one measure of the degree of familial clustering of the disease.Family and twin studies indicate that a substantial fraction of susceptibility to type 1 diabetes is attributable to genetic factors.These and other epidemiologic studies also implicate environmental factors as important triggers.Although the specific environmental factors that contribute to immune-mediated diabetes remain unknown, several of the relevant genetic factors have been identified using two main approaches: genome-wide linkage analysis and candidate gene association studies.This article reviews the epidemiology of type 1 diabetes, the relative merits of linkage and association studies, and the results achieved so far using these two approaches.Prospects for the future of type 1 diabetes genetics research are considered.Family and twin studies indicate that a substantial fraction of susceptibility to type 1 diabetes is attributable to genetic factors.These and other epidemiologic studies also implicate environmental factors as important triggers.Although the specific environmental factors that contribute to immune-mediated diabetes remain unknown, several of the relevant genetic factors have been identified using two main approaches: genome-wide linkage analysis and candidate gene association studies.This article reviews the epidemiology of type 1 diabetes, the relative merits of linkage and association studies, and the results achieved so far using these two approaches.Prospects for the future of type 1 diabetes genetics research are considered.",

      "Thus, the most likely scenario is that these genes are more poised for activation in the case group compared with the control group, contributing to various diabetes complications in the long term.This could be a consequence of the early exposure to hyperglycemia (measured by HbA 1c level), which is known to be associated with increased rates of long-term diabetes complications.",
      "Genetic Background and EnvironmentBoth type 1 and 2 diabetes as well as other rare forms of diabetes that are directly inherited, including MODY and diabetes due to mutations in mitochondrial DNA, are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors.Unlike some traits, diabetes does not seem to be inherited in a simple pattern.Undoubtedly, however, some people are born prone to developing diabetes more so than others.Several epidemiological patterns suggest that environmental factors contribute to the etiology of T1D.Interestingly, the recent elevated number of T1D incidents projects a changing global environment, which acts either as initiator and/or accelerator of beta cell autoimmunity rather than variation in the gene pool.Several genetic factors are involved in the development of the disease [127].There is evidence that more than twenty regions of the genome are involved in the genetic susceptibility to T1D.",
      "Type 1 DiabetesThe higher type 1 diabetes prevalence observed in relatives implies a genetic risk, and the degree of genetic identity with the proband correlates with risk (22)(23)(24)(25)(26). Gene variants in one major locus, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) (27), confer 50-60% of the genetic risk by affecting HLA protein binding to antigenic peptides and antigen presentation to T cells (28).Approximately 50 additional genes individually contribute smaller effects (25,29).These contributors include gene variants that modulate immune regulation and tolerance (30)(31)(32)(33), variants that modify viral responses (34,35), and variants that influence responses to environmental signals and endocrine function (36), as well as some that are expressed in pancreatic b-cells (37).Genetic influences on the triggering of islet autoimmunity and disease progression are being defined in relatives (38,39).Together, these gene variants explain ;80% of type 1 diabetes heritability.Epigenetic (40), gene expression, and regulatory RNA profiles (36) may vary over time and reflect disease activity, providing a dynamic readout of risk.GeneticsBoth type 1 and type 2 diabetes are polygenic diseases where many common variants, largely with small effect size, contribute to overall disease risk.Disease heritability (h 2 ), defined as sibling-relative risk, is 3 for type 2 diabetes and 15 for type 1 diabetes (17).The lifetime risk of developing type 2 diabetes is ;40% if one parent has type 2 diabetes and higher if the mother has the disease (18).The risk for type 1 diabetes is ;5% if a parent has type 1 diabetes and higher if the father has the disease (19).Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic disease and has a high h 2 of ;50 (20).Mutations in any 1 of 13 different individual genes have been identified to cause MODY (21), and a genetic diagnosis can be critical for selecting the most appropriate therapy.For example, children with mutations in KCJN11 causing MODY should be treated with sulfonylureas rather than insulin.",

      "Genetic factors have an important role in the development of diabetes, with some forms of the disease resulting from mutations in a single gene.Others are multifactorial in origin.The monogenic forms of diabetes account for approximately 5% of cases and are caused by mutations in genes encoding insulin 3 , the insulin receptor 4 , the glycolytic enzyme glucokinase 5 , and the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF-1), HNF-1, HNF-4, insulin promoter factor-1 and NeuroD1/BETA2 (refs  6-10).Mutations in maternally inherited mitochondrial genes can also cause diabetes, often in association with hearing loss 11 .",
      "The proportion of diabetics t h a t will result frommating between genetic types can be predicted withcertainty, since the inheritance is known to be underthe control of a recessive gene with complete penetrance. Offspring t h a t will exhibit the diabetic syndrome can be distinguished from those t h a t will not,as early as 3 weeks after birth. Some disadvantages are equally apparent. Diabetichomozygotes do not breed, and heterozygotes cannotbe distinguished from normals except b y progenytesting.",
      "Studies [71][72][73][74] in Mexican and Asian populations have identified several mutations associated with type 2 diabetes in young people.The high prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the parents of young people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes could reflect a stronger genetic predisposition, even when monogenic diabetes is excluded.This hypothesis suggests that efforts to define genes that cause type 2 diabetes by linkage might be more powerful if focused on young adults with diabetes, raising the question of whether type 2 diabetes in older populations has a relatively smaller genetic contribution and a stronger environmental contribution. 66",
      "Genetics is one example of the 'other risk factors' involved in the pathogenesis of DR.Twin and epidemiological studies have strongly suggested a genetic component in the etiology of DR (6 -10), with heritability scores ranging from 27 to 52% in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (7 -10).There is an increased risk of severe DR among family members of DR subjects (8,9) and in siblings of affected subjects (8,9).Furthermore, several studies have also shown a discrepant rate of the prevalence of DR among different racial ethnic groups in the US population, with a significantly higher prevalence observed among Hispanic, African-American and Chinese-American when compared with Caucasian populations (11).While these differences may partially be attributed to lifestyle factors, evidence from familial aggregation, ethnic differences and heritability clearly supports a genetic contribution in the etiology of DR."

      "To see which other significant genes were likely to have a role in diabetes we looked at all variant sets with a significant glucose, HbA1c, or T2D association and examined whether they had associations with additional diabetes traits (p  0.0016, correcting for 32 sets tested).Damaging missense variants in PDX1 and PFAS, which significantly associated with HbA1c levels in our primary analysis, associated with T2D diagnosis using this threshold (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 14).Identification of genes with a biological role in diabetes. Variants in two genes, GCK and GIGYF1, significantly associated with glucose, HbA1c and T2D diagnosis, strongly suggesting a biological role in diabetes; GCK is involved in Mendelian forms of diabetes while GIGYF1 has not previously been implicated by genetics in the disease.Both GCK and GIGYF1 are located on chromosome 7 but are 56 Mb apart, strongly suggesting that these signals are independent; this independence was confirmed by conditional analysis (Supplementary Table 13).Two additional variant sets, HNF1A pLOF and TNRC6B pLOF, had genome-wide associations with both T2D diagnosis and HbA1c levels while G6PC2 damaging missense variants associated with decreased levels of both glucose and HbA1c but not T2D diagnosis (Table 3).",
      "One obvious locus to consider is TCF7L2 in the context of type 2 diabetes.Common genetic variation located within the gene encoding transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L2) has been consistently reported to be strongly associated with the disease.Such reports range from 2006, when we first published the association [3], to the recent transethnic meta-analysis GWAS of type 2 diabetes [4].",
      "Testing of these loci for association with T2D as a dichotomous trait in up to 40,655 cases and 87,022 nondiabetic controls demonstrated that the fasting glucose-raising alleles at seven loci (in or near ADCY5, PROX1, GCK, GCKR and DGKB-TMEM195 and the known T2D genes TCF7L2 and SLC30A8) are robustly associated (P < 5  10 8 ) with increased risk of T2D (Table 2).The association of a highly correlated SNP in ADCY5 with T2D in partially overlapping samples is reported by our companion manuscript 29 .We found less significant T2D associations (P < 5  10 3 ) for variants in or near CRY2, FADS1, GLIS3 and C2CD4B (Table 2).These data clearly show that loci with similar fasting glucose effect sizes may have very different T2D risk effects (see, for example, ADCY5 and MADD in Table 2).",
      "Among the confirmed and potential type 2 diabetes risk genes described in Tables 1 and 2, eight genes influence whole-body or peripheral insulin sensitivity: ADIPOQ (47, 52, 250 -257), AHSG (75, 258), CAPN10 (259 -264), ENPP1 (265)(266)(267)(268)(269)(270)(271), PPARG (272)(273)(274)(275)(276)(277)(278)(279)(280)(281)(282)(283), PPARGC1A (284,285), SREBF1 (65), and TCF7L2 (133,151,286,287).",
      "Despite identification of many putative causative genetic variants, few have generated credible susceptibility variants for type 2 diabetes.Indeed, the most important finding using linkage studies is the discovery that the alteration of TCF7L2 (TCF-4) gene expression or function (33) disrupts pancreatic islet function and results in enhanced risk of type 2 diabetes.Candidate gene studies have also reported many type 2 diabetes-associated loci and the coding variants in the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g (34), the potassium channel KCNJ11 (34), WFS1 (35), and HNF1B (TCF2) (36) are among the few that have been replicated (Table 2).Recently, there have been great advances in the analysis of associated variants in GWA and replication studies due to highthroughput genotyping technologies, the International HapMap Project, and the Human Genome Project.Type 2 susceptibility loci such as JAZF1, CDC123-CAMK1D, TSPAN8-LGR5, THADA, ADAMTS9, NOTCH2, and ADCY5 (37,38) are among some of the established loci (Table 2).CDKN2A/B, CDKAL1, SLC30A8, IGF2BP2, HHEX/IDE, and FTO are other established susceptibility loci for diabetes (Table 2) (34,39,40).GWA studies have also identified the potassium voltage-gated channel KCNQ1 (32) as an associated gene variant for diabetes.A recent GWA study reporting a genetic variant with a strong association with insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and type 2 diabetes, located adjacent to the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) gene, is the C allele of rs2943641 (41).Interestingly, the parental origin of the single nucleotide polymorphism is of importance because the allele that confers risk when paternally inherited is protected when maternally transmitted.GWA studies for glycemic traits have identified loci such as MTNR1B (42), GCK (glucokinase) (42), and GCKR (glucokinase receptor) (42); however, further investigation of genetic loci on glucose homeostasis and their impact on type 2 diabetes is needed.Indeed, a recent study by Soranzo et al. (42) using GWA studies identified ten genetic loci associated with HbA 1c .Genetic factors affecting expression, turnover, and abnormal glycation of hemoglobin may be associated with changes in levels of HbA 1c .",
      "G enome-wide association studies (GWAS) have iden- tified several type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) susceptibility loci including CDKAL1, CDKN2B, IGF2BP2, HHEX, SLC30A8, PKN2, LOC387761 (1)(2)(3)(4)(5), and KCNQ1, which was recently identified by similar GWAS approach in two independent Japanese samples (6,7).Although these associations have been well replicated in Japanese populations (8), the role of these loci in other East Asian populations remains less clear.For example, a study in China by Wu et al. (9) did not find significant associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IGF2BP2 and SLC30A8 with T2DM, whereas an association between SNPs at the HHEX locus and T2DM was reported among Chinese living in Shanghai, but not among Chinese in Beijing.Another study in Hong Kong Chinese (10) also did not find an association with SNPs at the IGF2BP2 locus; however, they reported an association between T2DM with SNPs at the HHEX and SLC30A8 loci.",
      "In studies where overt T2D has been the phenotype the majority of associated polymorphisms have encoded proteins known to be involved in -cell metabolism; for example TCF7L2, KCNJ11 and HHEX have shown robust association [170,171].This suggests that these genes could prove useful in predicting -cell preservation during the course of T2D.The glucokinase gene (GCK) coding for the initial glucose-sensing step in the -cell can have activating mutations causing hypoglycemia that might provide structural and functional models leading to drug targets for treating T2D [172].In the GoDARTs study, investigators examined the medication response of metformin and sulphonylurea based on the TCF7L2 variants mainly affecting the -cell.The carriers of the at risk 'T' allele responded less well to sulphonylurea therapy than metformin [173].Also it is of significant public health interest that in the Diabetes Prevention Program, lifestyle modifications were shown to reduce the risk of diabetes conferred by risk variants of TCF7L2 at rs7093146, and in placebo participants who carried the homozygous risk genotype (TT), there was 80% higher risk for developing diabetes compared to the lifestyle intervention group carrying the same risk genotypes [35].These findings could herald significant future progress in the field of T2D pharmacogenomics, possibly leading to the development and use of agents tailored on the basis of genotype.",
      "Despite sharing only 9 loci (among 26 and 17 total in the two analyses, respectively), the separate analyses both identified genes involved in diabetes-related biological functions, including \"glucose homeostasis,\" \"pancreas development\" and \"insulin secretion\" (Supplementary Tables 3 and 5).Three of the top eleven scoring genes in our independent replication analysis have verified causal links to T2D, as annotated in the OMIM 41 .These include genes encoding transcription factors TCF7L2 (TCF4), which has extensive evidence of being causal in T2D 61,62 , and HNF1B, which is a known cause of maturity onset diabetes of the young 63 .Other high-ranking candidate genes have been identified as therapeutic targets in T2D (for example, CTBP1 (ref.64) and LEP 65 ), and the high-scoring gene HHEX has recently been shown to play a key role in islet function 66 .",
      "Similar findings to AMD are now unfolding with type 2 DM.Grant et al. (24) first reported on a variant of the gene TCF7L2, which has been linked to reduced beta cell function and poor insulin response to oral glucose loads (51).Since its first discovery, this gene has been widely confirmed in independent studies as a pivotal susceptibility marker for type 2 DM (23,(25)(26)(27)(28)40).Recently, 6 genome-wide SNP association studies have identified and replicated in separate stages several additional novel genes conferring susceptibility to type 2 DM (23,(25)(26)(27)(28)40) (Table 2).Interestingly, these loci primarily include genes involved in pancreatic beta cell development and function as opposed to insulin resistance-the current accepted mechanism for type 2 DM.This development casts doubt on our traditional pathophysiological modeling of the type 2 diabetic patient and underscores the need for genomic studies to further define pathobiological processes of complex traits.",
      "Of the 16 loci that have been associated with type 2 diabetes previously, [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] we showed that 11 -TCF7L2, PPARG, FTO, KCNJ11, NOTCH2, WFS1, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, JAZF1, and HHEXwere associated with an enhanced risk of future diabetes.Many of the variants that we genotyped appear to influence beta-cell function, possibly through effects on proliferation, regeneration, and apoptosis.There was a time-dependent increase in the BMI and a decrease in insulin sensitivity in the subjects from the Botnia study, an increase in insulin resistance that was reflected by an increase in insulin secretion.However, this increase was inadequate to compensate for the increase in insulin resistance in carriers with a high genetic risk, which resulted in a markedly impaired disposition index.Only variants in FTO were associated with an increased BMI.Both FTO and PPARG together with TCF7L2 and KCNJ11 predicted transition from impaired fasting glucose levels or impaired glucose tolerance to manifest diabetes, which suggests that a combination of increased obesity and insulin resistance with a deterioration in beta-cell function contribute to the manifestation of diabetes in these subjects.Collectively, our findings emphasize the critical role of inherited defects in beta-cell function for the development of type 2 diabetes.Type 2 DiabetesCommon variants in 11 genes were significantly associated with the risk of future type 2 diabetes in the MPP cohort, including TCF7L2 (odds ratio, 1.30; P = 9.510 13 ), PPARG (odds ratio, 1.20; P = 4.010 4 ), FTO (odds ratio, 1.14; P = 9.210 5 ), KCNJ11 (odds ratio, 1.13; P = 3.610 4 ), NOTCH2 (odds ratio, 1.13; P = 0.02), WFS1 (odds ratio, 1.12; P = 0.001), CDKAL1 (odds ratio, 1.11; P = 0.004), IGF2BP2 (odds ratio, 1.10; P = 0.008), SLC30A8 (odds ratio, 1.10; P = 0.008), JAZF1 (odds ratio, 1.08; P = 0.03), and HHEX (odds ratio, 1.07; P = 0.03) (Table 2).Although these findings could not be fully replicated in the smaller Botnia study, there was little heterogeneity between the studies with respect to the risk conferred by different genotypes.",
      "To date, more than 70 genes have been identified as involved in T2DM, primarily by association analysis [34].In addition, via GWAS arrays, more than 100 SNPs have been identified for T2DM [35].From the 50 novel loci associated with T2DM previously identified, more than 40 loci have been associated with T2DM-related traits, including fasting proinsulin, insulin and glucose (Table 1) [36][37][38][39].However, for T2DM-related traits, such as the HOMA index or pancreatic  cell function, there are virtually no published data examining the relationship between these traits or the genotype and environment interactions.Clinical investigations of some loci have suggested that the genetic components of T2DM risk act preferentially through  cell function [40].Among all 40 loci associated with T2DM-related traits, only transcription factor-7-like 2 (TCF7L2) was shown to clearly contribute to T2DM risk [41].Several studies in white European [42], Indian [43], Japanese [44], Mexican American [45] and West African [46] individuals have shown a strong association between TCF7L2 and T2DM.It is also noteworthy that these populations represent the major racial groups with a high prevalence of T2DM.In all populations, TCF7L2 showed a strong association, with the odds of developing T2DM increased by 30%-50% for each allele inherited.This finding indicates an approximately double odds ratio compared to most other diabetes susceptibility polymorphisms.TCF7L2 is a transcription factor involved in the Wnt signaling pathway that is ubiquitously expressed, and it has been observed that TCF7L2 risk alleles result in the overexpression of TCF7L2 in pancreatic  cells.This overexpression causes reduced nutrient-induced insulin secretion, which results in a direct predisposition to T2DM as well as an indirect predisposition via an increase in hepatic glucose production [47].Most Relevant T2DM Susceptibility GenesGene and environment interaction studies have shown a nice association between variants in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), TCF7L2 and fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) genes, a Western dietary pattern and T2DM.",
      "One of these genes associated with type 2 diabetes is the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1, OMIM association number, 147545) (Alharbi, Khan, Abotalib, & Al-Hakeem, 2014;Alharbi, Khan, Munshi et al., 2014;Brender et al., 2013;Brunetti, Chiefari, & Foti, 2014) and another is the C-C motif chemokine receptor5(CCR5, OMIM association number, 601373) (Balistreri et al., 2007;Mokubo et al., 2006;Muntinghe et al., 2009).",

CONCLUSIONS-Ourfindings support the important but differential contribution of these genetic variants to type 2 diabetes and obesity in Asians compared with Europeans.Diabetes 57: 2226-2233, 2008T ype 2 diabetes is a major health problem affecting more than 170 million people worldwide.In the next 20 years, Asia will be hit hardest, with the diabetic populations in India and China more than doubling (1).Type 2 diabetes is characterized by the presence of insulin resistance and pancreatic -cell dysfunction, resulting from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors.Until recently, few genes identified through linkage scans or the candidate gene approach have been confirmed to be associated with type 2 diabetes (e.g., PPARG, KCNJ11, CAPN10, and TCF7L2).Under the common variant-common disease hypothesis, several genome-wide association (GWA) studies on type 2 diabetes have been conducted in large-scale case-control samples.Six novel genes (SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKAL1, CDKN2A and CDKN2B, IGF2BP2, and FTO) with modest effect for type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.14 -1.20) had been reproducibly demonstrated in multiple populations of European ancestry.Moreover, TCF7L2 was shown to have the largest effect for type 2 diabetes (1.37) in the European populations to date (2-8).Although many of these genes may be implicated in the insulin production/secretion pathway (TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, and IGF2BP2) (6,9 -11), FTO is associated with type 2 diabetes through its regulation of adiposity (8,12,13).Moreover, two adjacent regions near CDKN2A/B are associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases risks, respectively (7,14 -16).Despite the consistent associations among Europeans, the contributions of these genetic variants in other ethnic groups are less clear.Given the differences in environmental factors (e.g., lifestyle), risk factor profiles (body composition and insulin secretion/resistance patterns), and genetic background (linkage disequilibrium pattern and risk allele frequencies) between Europeans and Asians, it is important to understand the role of these genes in Asians.A recent case-control study in 1,728 Japanese subjects revealed nominal association to type 2 diabetes for variants at the SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKAL1, CDKN2B, and FTO genes but not IGF2BP2 (17).In the present large-scale case-control replication study of 6,719 Asians, we aimed to test for the association of six novel genes from GWA studies and TCF7L2, which had the largest effect in Europeans, and their joint effects on type 2 diabetes risk and metabolic traits.

      "IntroductionMany genes have been evaluated as candidates for T2D susceptibility.However, only variants in the TCF7L2, PPARG, KCNJ11 and HNFA4 genes have been extensively replicated in populations around the world, showing their indisputable association with T2D risk (Zeggini 2007).In the particular case of the HNF4A gene, it has been implicated in maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 1 (MODY 1) (Mitchell and Frayling 2002;Zhu et al. 2003).HNF4A is a member of the nuclear receptor super-family that plays a critical role in embryogenesis and metabolism, by regulating gene expression in pancreatic beta cells, liver and other tissues.The HNF4A gene is localized to chromosome 20q13, a region that has demonstrated evidence for linkage with T2D (Sladek et al. 1990;Ghosh et al. 1999).Several genetic studies, mainly in Caucasian and Asian populations, have provided evidence for the association of the variants in HNF4A with T2D (Ghosh et al. 1999;Silander et al. 2004;Winckler et al. 2005)."

      "Type 2 diabetes is now a pandemic and shows no signs of abatement.In this Seminar we review the pathophysiology of this disorder, with particular attention to epidemiology, genetics, epigenetics, and molecular cell biology.Evidence is emerging that a substantial part of diabetes susceptibility is acquired early in life, probably owing to fetal or neonatal programming via epigenetic phenomena.Maternal and early childhood health might, therefore, be crucial to the development of eff ective prevention strategies.Diabetes develops because of inadequate islet -cell and adipose-tissue responses to chronic fuel excess, which results in so-called nutrient spillover, insulin resistance, and metabolic stress.The latter damages multiple organs.Insulin resistance, while forcing  cells to work harder, might also have an important defensive role against nutrient-related toxic eff ects in tissues such as the heart.Reversal of overnutrition, healing of the  cells, and lessening of adipose tissue defects should be treatment priorities.Type 2 diabetes is now a pandemic and shows no signs of abatement.In this Seminar we review the pathophysiology of this disorder, with particular attention to epidemiology, genetics, epigenetics, and molecular cell biology.Evidence is emerging that a substantial part of diabetes susceptibility is acquired early in life, probably owing to fetal or neonatal programming via epigenetic phenomena.Maternal and early childhood health might, therefore, be crucial to the development of eff ective prevention strategies.Diabetes develops because of inadequate islet -cell and adipose-tissue responses to chronic fuel excess, which results in so-called nutrient spillover, insulin resistance, and metabolic stress.The latter damages multiple organs.Insulin resistance, while forcing  cells to work harder, might also have an important defensive role against nutrient-related toxic eff ects in tissues such as the heart.Reversal of overnutrition, healing of the  cells, and lessening of adipose tissue defects should be treatment priorities.",
      "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a result of complex gene-environment interactions, and several risk factors have been identified, including age, family history, diet, sedentary lifestyle and obesity.Statistical models that combine known risk factors for T2D can partly identify individuals at high risk of developing the disease.However, these studies have so far indicated that human genetics contributes little to the models, whereas socio-demographic and environmental factors have greater influence 1 .Recent evidence suggests the importance of the gut microbiota as an environmental factor, and an altered gut microbiota has been linked to metabolic diseases including obesity 2,3 , diabetes 4 and cardiovascular disease 5 .",
      "The prevalence of diabetes mellitus worldwide is sobering; the International Diabetes Federation estimates that 415 million people have diabetes mellitus, with 90% of these individuals having type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 1 .T2DM occurs when pancreatic -cells fail to release enough insulin to meet the demands of insulin-responsive tissues, which safely store and metabolize glucose.Driven by both genetic and environmental risk factors, T2DM is a complex, multifactorial disorder.Although the increasing prevalence of T2DM is driven by changes in our environment and mirrors the increase in obesity, the greater concordance for T2DM found in monozygotic compared with dizygotic twins has long provided evidence for a genetic component in T2DM risk 2 .",
      "DietExcessive caloric intake is a major driving force behind escalating obesity and type 2 diabetes epidemics worldwide, but diet quality also has independent effects.In the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), we found that the quality of fats and carbohydrates play an important role in the development of diabetes, independent of BMI and other risk factors (11).In particular, higher dietary glycemic load (GL) and trans fat are associated with increased diabetes risk, whereas greater consumption of cereal fiber and polyunsaturated fat is associated with decreased risk (Fig. 2).In a meta-analysis, we found that a 2 serving/day increment in whole-grain intake was associated with a 21% lower risk of diabetes (12).",
      "IntroductionThe aetiology of type 2 diabetes is poorly defined: several studies indicate that the disease results from a combination of genetic susceptibility and external risk factors [1].According to this multifactorial model, genetically predisposed subjects will not necessarily develop overt disease unless they are also exposed to particular environmental factors [2].Important risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes include a family history of diabetes, increased age, hypertension, lack of physical exercise, and obesity [1].",
      "BackgroundNearly 350 million people world-wide are currently affected by diabetes, and the number of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing at an alarming rate [1].Type 2 diabetes results when the -cells of the pancreas are no longer capable of producing sufficient insulin to meet the body's demands.Thus -cell dysfunction is a key component of type 2 diabetes pathology.Although the increased prevalence of obesity and resulting insulin resistance is contributing to the increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes, many obese individuals are insulin resistant but do not develop diabetes [2].Genetic factors, many of which have been proposed to affect -cell function, play an important role in determining an individual's risk within this context [3][4][5][6].In a small number of individuals, type 2 diabetes is caused by rare single gene mutations, but for most individuals type 2 diabetes results from the combined effects of many common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), each of which have a small effect on risk and likely interact with each other and with environmental and lifestyle factors [7].",
      "Type I Diabetes is a disease that results when cells, such as fat and muscle cells, do not properly take up sugar from the blood.There are many symptoms of diabetes; however, one common symptom is a large increase of glucose levels in the blood, called hyperglycemia, because glucose cannot enter the other cells of the body.Hyperglycemia can cause blurred vision and can make one feel extremely hungry and very tired.In extreme cases it can 10 21 cause loss of consciousness.Type I diabetes is a genetic disease.",
      "What these predisposing factors share is an ability to negatively impact the glucose homeostasis system through worsening of insulin resistance or to impair b-cell function.Superimposing these factors onto a genetically compromised glucose homeostasis system raises the risk of progressing to hyperglycemia.It is the rapid emergence of these disadvantageous environmental factors that is causing the worldwide diabetes epidemic.This concept of environmental changes promoting diabetes was highlighted many years ago by populations that rarely experienced type 2 diabetes, but then moved from a nomadic or farm existence to urban environments followed by an explosion of diabetes, typically with profound obesity: Pima Indians in the Southwest U.S., Saharan nomadic tribes, Australian Aborigines, and many others.Particularly dramatic were studies that showed reversal of the diabetes when they returned to their prior way of life (15).A recent example of this is the rapidly rising incidence of type 2 diabetes in China and India as people move from the country to cities-there is a 0.1-0.2%incidence of diabetes for rural farmers in China as opposed to well more than 5% for city dwellers.Perhaps the scariest example of this is children in the U.S. where the obesity statistics worsen yearly.As many as 20% of U.S. children are now obese, and they are developing all of the elements of the metabolic syndrome-insulin resistance, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance (16).",
      "BackgroundType 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common, chronic disease caused by both genetic and environmental risk factors and their interactions [1], which has significantly increased prevalence in the past 20 years [2] and disproportionately afflicts communities of color [3][4][5].The current screening of T2D focuses on individuals with demographic and clinical risk factors, including overweight or obesity, age >35 years, and a family history of diabetes [6].However, despite preventative strategies and public health efforts to improve nutrition and physical activity, facilitate access to care, and limit tobacco and alcohol use, the morbidity and mortality associated with T2D remain unaltered [5], likely because most interventions are adopted too late in the course of disease trajectory.",
      "BackgroundType 2 diabetes is a cause of poor health and early death that is spreading worldwide and exerting a fearsome human and economic toll [1,2].Prevention and control of diabetes requires a better understanding of its basic molecular causes.Type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disease arising from physiological dysfunction in the pancreas, skeletal muscle, liver, adipose and vascular tissue.Much of the heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes has a genetic basis.A full picture of the complex genetic architecture of diabetes has been elusive [3][4][5][6][7].",
      "RACIALIZED ETIOLOGIES OF DIABETESDiabetes is not one disease but many.More than 90 percent of all diabetics have type 2 diabetes, which is characterized by elevated blood glucose triggered by a combination of poor insulin production, insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and lipid tissue, or both.Type 2 diabetes is also known as Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes because, unlike the rarer form of the disease, people with type 2 diabetes produce insulin and therefore seldom need therapeutic insulin at the initial onset of disease.Type 2 diabetes (hereafter, \"diabetes\"), like heart disease, hypertension and asthma, is referred to as a complex disease because its putative determinants lay in both environmental and biological domains.That is, diabetes is caused by a still-unknown combination of factors that include lifestyle, diet, physical activity, and an array of physiological triggers.",
      "IntroductionType 2 diabetes (T2D) affects at least 6% of the world's population; the worldwide prevalence is expected to double by 2025 [1].T2D is a complex disorder that is characterized by hyperglycemia, which results from impaired pancreatic b cell function, decreased insulin action at target tissues, and increased glucose output by the liver [2].Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of T2D.The disease is considered to be a polygenic disorder in which each genetic variant confers a partial and additive effect.Only 5%-10% of T2D cases are due to single gene defects; these include maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), insulin resistance syndromes, mitochondrial diabetes, and neonatal diabetes [3][4][5].Inherited variations have been identified from studies of monogenic diabetes, and have provided insights into b cell physiology, insulin release, and the action of insulin on target cells [6].",
      "The worldwide explosion of the rates of diabetes and other metabolic diseases in the last few decades cannot be fully explained only by changes in the prevalence of classical lifestyle-related risk factors, such as physical inactivity and poor diet.For this reason, it has been recently proposed that other \"nontraditional\" risk factors could contribute to the diabetes epidemics.In particular, an increasing number of reports indicate that chronic exposure to and accumulation of a low concentration of environmental pollutants (especially the so-called persistent organic pollutants (POPs)) within the body might be associated with diabetogenesis.In this review, the epidemiological evidence suggesting a relationship between dioxin and other POPs exposure and diabetes incidence will be summarized, and some recent developments on the possible underlying mechanisms, with particular reference to dioxin, will be presented and discussed.",
      "| DISCUSSIONThe rapidly increasing number of diabetic patients becomes a global burden especially for health sector in low-and middleincome countries including Bangladesh (Bleich, Koehlmoos, Rashid, Peters, & Anderson, 2011).Many reasons such as obesity, lack of physical activity, food habit, sedentary job nature and genetic makeup are factors accounting for developing diabetes (Lyssenko & Laakso, 2013;Vilchis-Gil, Galvn-Portillo, Klnder-Klnder, Cruz, & Flores-Huerta, 2015).Another cause is stress, which plays important role in the etiology of T2DM (S.J. Kelly & Ismail, 2015;Pouwer et al., 2010).Type 2 diabetic patients not only have to cope with this chronic disease, they are also at increased risk for several diseases like coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy (Pouwer et al., 2010).To fight and control T2DM we have to seek out an alternative way of diagnosis and treatment based on patient's genetic information.This requires a deep insight into the etiology of this disease including associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).",
      "BackgroundType 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disease that affects 25.8 million Americans in 2011, according to statistics reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).T2D occurs when the body develops resistance to insulin due to the malfunction of insulin producing -cells.The developmental process of T2D involves a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors.However, it is not clear how the underlying genetic defects give rise to T2D pathogenesis over time.Recent T2D genetic study results, particularly those from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have yielded insights to the molecular mechanisms and underlying genetic risk factors of T2D [1].Among the many risk genes identified are: transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) [2][3][4], peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) [5][6][7], and potassium inwardlyrectifying channel, subfamily J, member 11 (KCNJ11) [5,6].",
      "Aetiological factorsProspective studies suggest that the main pathophysiological defects leading to type 2 diabetes are insulin resistance and a relative insulin secretory defect.The main aetiological risk factors are age, obesity, family history, and physical inactivity.Dietary risk factors have recently emerged: risk is increased by high consumption of red and processed meat 13 and sugar-sweetened beverages, 14 and reduced by intake of fruit and vegetables, 15 some types of dairy products, 16 and some overall dietary patterns. 17Novel strategies to use quantifiable nutritional biomarkers are paving the way for more detailed understanding of the association between diet and diabetes.Although the heritability of type 2 diabetes is high (30e70%) and more than 60 genetic variants related with diabetes risk have now been identified, 18   even when combined into a genetic score, known genes contribute little to the prediction of diabetes.Phenotype-based risk models provide greater discrimination for diabetes, and the addition of genotypic information adds no more than 5e10% improvement in prediction.The current conclusion is that genetic variants provide insights into biological pathways and pathogenesis of diabetes, but not its prediction.It is likely that interactions between the environment/lifestyle and genetic factors provide the explanation for the risk of type 2 diabetes, but demonstrating such interaction is challenging.Encouraging research findings have recently shown higher absolute risk of diabetes associated with obesity at any level of genetic risk. 19evention and screening",
      "IntroductionType 2 diabetes (T2D) is caused by the inability to regulate glucose levels as a result of insufficient insulin production or the incapability of the body to use bioavailable insulin (Asif 2014;Wong and Tabet 2015).Because of its complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy and heart disease, T2D is a critical disorder threatening adult health and life in humans.The number of T2D patients has steadily increased in recent decades and will continue to increase in the future, and is projected to reach 592 million patients worldwide by 2035 (Guariguata et al. 2014).In particular, Asian countries account for more than 60% of the world's T2D patients, and the T2D population is growing rapidly (Ramachandran et al. 2012).",
      "IntroductionDiabetes mellitus, also known as simply diabetes, is the most prevalent disease in Westernized, developed countries, and the prevalence of this disease increases with age, accounting for 8.4% of all deaths worldwide [1].Diabetes is a well-recognized multifactorial endocrine metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period) triggered by insulin secretion deficiencies, insulin action or both [2].The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with dysfunction, long-term damage and failure of different organs, particularly the kidneys, heart, blood vessels, nerves and eyes.The development of diabetes involves various pathogenic processes including autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic -cells with subsequent insulin insufficiency which causes insulin resistance [3].The reason for the carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism disorders in diabetes is insulin deficient activity on target tissues.Insulin deficient action results from insufficient insulin secretion and/or diminished tissue response [4].The great majority of diabetes cases fall into two broad categories of etiopathogenetics.Type 1 diabetes (T1D), falls in one category, is caused due to an absolute deficiency in insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells.Genetic marker tests and serological evidences of an autoimmune pathological process in pancreatic islets can often be utilized for identification of individuals with increased risk of developing T1D [5].The more prevalent form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which falls in the second category and is caused by a combination of insulin resistance and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response [6].Consequently, a degree of hyperglycemia occurs that might cause pathological and functional changes in different target tissues but without clinical symptoms and the condition may persist for a long time before T2DM is detected.There are other specific types of diabetes, such as exocrine pancreatic diseases, endocrinopathies, diabetes induced by drugs or chemicals, infection, uncommon forms of immune-mediated diabetes, other genetic syndromes, such as Down syndrome chromosomal abnormalities, Klinefelter syndrome, and sometimes diabetes-related Turner syndrome.Depending on the severity of the underlying disease, the degree of hyperglycemia can change over time [7]."
