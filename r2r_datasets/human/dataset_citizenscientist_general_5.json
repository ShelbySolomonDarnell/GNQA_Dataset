    "The difference between X and Y DNA in terms of DNA tracing and determining QTLs is not explicitly discussed in the background text. However, it is mentioned that the mouse genome consists of 19 pairs of autosomes and the X and Y chromosomes. In general, the X and Y chromosomes are different in size, gene content, and inheritance patterns, which could potentially influence the process of DNA tracing and determining QTLs. However, specific methods or implications related to these differences are not detailed in the provided text."

      "Serum lipids are important determinants of cardiovascular diseases and are related to morbidity [187] .The high heritability of circulating lipid levels is well established, and earlier studies of individuals with extreme lipid values or families with Mendelian forms of dyslipidemias have reported the involvement of numerous genes and respective proteins in lipid metabolism [188] .Recent GWA studies mostly carried out in samples enriched for T2DM cases have implicated a total of 19 loci controlling serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides (TG).The loci include the genes encoding ABCA1 , APOB , CELSR2 , CETP , DOCK7 , GALNT2 , GCKR , HMGCR , LDLR , LIPC , LIPG , LPL , MLXIPL , shown according to the number of at -risk alleles in each class (for a total of 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in each individual, from the best replicated variants following the results of genome -wide association studies).The study was performed in 4232 patients with diabetes and 4595 normoglycemic adult subjects.Adapted from Cauchi et al.

      "Familial HypercholesterolemiaFamilial hypercholesterolemia is an inherited condition in which patients have extremely high blood levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which results in abnormal deposition of cholesterol in various parts of the body and a dramatically increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which often manifests at an early age.Several genes have been implicated in this disorder.Mutations in LDLR, which encodes the LDL receptor, can affect the synthesis, structure, and function of the LDL receptor in a variety of ways, 6 resulting in the impaired ability of cells to remove cholesterol-carrying LDL particles from the bloodstream and thus the accumulation of LDL cholesterol in the blood.Although familial hypercholesterolemia is often regarded as an autosomal dominant disorder, LDLR mutations have an additive (codominant) effect such that patients who have 2 LDLR mutations have higher blood LDL cholesterol levels and experience earlier cardiovascular disease (as early as childhood) compared with patients with 1 LDLR mutation.Mutations in the APOB gene, which encodes the apolipoprotein B protein, which is a core protein of LDL particles and facilitates their removal from the bloodstream, can mimic the effects of LDLR mutations and result in familial hypercholesterolemia. 7 Finally, mutations in 2 other genes that encode proteins that affect the function of the LDL receptor, PCSK9 and LDLRAP1, can also result in familial hypercholesterolemia. 8,9 Unlike the other 3 genes, LDLRAP1 mutations are recessive and thus are required to affect both copies of the gene for patients to manifest disease.",
      "Dyslipidemia was defined according to ATP III.High TC was defined as serum level of TC equal to or greater than 6.21 mmol/L (!240 mg/dL).Low HDL-C was defined as serum level of HDL-C less than 1.03 mmol/L (<40 mg/dL).High LDL-C was defined as serum level of LDL-C equal to or greater than 4.16 mmol/L (!160 mg/dL).High TG was defined as serum level of triglyceride equal to or greater than 2.26 mmol/L (!200 mg/dL).The ratio of TC/HDL-C equal to or greater than five was defined as abnormal.All the participants were free of lipid-lowering medicines.Studies reported that dyslipidemia was associated with hypertension [27e30].However, in our current study, this association was not observed in the Yi people by multivariate logistic regression analysis.Significant association between ever alcohol drinking, dyslipidemia, low HDL-C and high ratio of TC/HDL-C was observed (OR<1).Our findings showed an association between increasing BMI and increasing prevalence of dyslipidemia.The association between ever smoking and dyslipidemia was not observed in the current research by multivariate logistic regression analysis.Compared with females aged below 45 years, females at menopausal stage had higher risk for dyslipidemia, adjusted for family income, educational level, physical activity, ever smoking, ever alcohol drinking, BMI, and history of hypertension and T2DM.In exploring associated factors for prevalence of dyslipidemia, we used multivariate logistic regression analysis with high TC, TG and LDL-C, low HDL-C and abnormal ratio of TC/HDL-C as dependent variables, respectively.Independent variables included age, gender, family income, educational level, physical activity, ever smoking, ever alcohol drinking, BMI, and history of hypertension and T2DM, each of them had a p-value less than 0.05.No factor associated with high LDL-C was observed.Overweight or obesity, and history of T2DM were independent factors related to dyslipidemia.Male Yi people had significantly higher risk for dyslipidemia, as compared with that in females.Ever alcohol drinking was associated with dyslipidemia, i.e., low HDL-C and higher ratio of TC/ HDL-C.Compared with light physical activity, people engaged in moderate or heavy labor had lower risk for high TG Fig. 1.Prevalence of dyslipidemia by time before and after emigration in the Yi migrants.There are some limitations in this study that require consideration in interpretation of our findings.One is limited sample size.Another one is that no dietary survey was conducted in the current study, so no dietary factors associated with dyslipidemia could be estimated.",
      "Perturbation of lipid metabolismIt is known that the characteristic features of dyslipidemia in humans with type 2 diabetes are high plasma triglyceride concentration, low HDL cholesterol concentrations and increased concentration of small dense LDL-cholesterol particles, while total cholesterol is not increased in patients with diabetes.These lipid changes in these individuals may be due to an increased free fatty acid flux secondary to insulin resistance [49].However, the perturbations observed here in lipid metabolism reflect the state of already treated diabetes.Association studies with blood lipid parameters [Adamski et al., unpublished data, [50]] show that many PC species associate with HDL and total cholesterol levels while PE species associate with triglyceride levels.In this study, we observed lower phosphatidylcholine (PC) and higher phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) concentration in the diabetes group matches the lower HDL and total cholesterol levels and higher triglyceride levels in this group, indicating that these glycerophospholipids may provide a more differentiated view of the shifted lipid homeostasis in patients with diabetes as what can be obtained from the bulk blood cholesterol and triglyceride parameters alone.Consistent with this finding, Gall et al. [34] observed reduced levels of multiple acylglycerophosphocholine species that were highly correlated with insulin resistance as measured by the euglycemic clamp.",
      "INTRODUCTIONCardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide (He et al., 2005;Lozano et al., 2013;Murray et al., 2013).Suboptimal lipid levels contribute to the atherosclerotic process, with clinical trials and observational studies demonstrating a strong relation between blood lipid concentrations and CVD (Hokanson and Austin, 1996;LaRosa et al., 1999;Di Angelantonio et al., 2009;Huxley et al., 2011).The heritabilities of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride concentrations have long been established (Friedlander et al., 1997;Malhotra and Wolford, 2005;Luo et al., 2010;Zhang et al., 2010).More recently, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have made important strides in identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that contribute to the inter-individual variability in these complex phenotypes (Saxena et al., 2007;Kathiresan et al., 2008;Kooner et al., 2008;Wallace et al., 2008;Willer et al., 2008;Aulchenko et al., 2009;Kathiresan et al., 2009;Teslovich et al., 2010;Waterworth et al., 2010;Kim et al., 2011;Tan et al., 2012).Despite such progress, up to 75% of the variance in lipid levels due to genetic factors remains unexplained (Teslovich et al., 2010).Further research is needed to identify novel variants, genes, and biological pathways with important influences on lipid phenotypes.",

      "Although hyperlipidemia is traditionally considered a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D), evidence has emerged from statin trials and candidate gene investigations suggesting that lower LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) increases T2D risk.We thus sought to more comprehensively examine the phenotypic and genotypic relationships of LDL-C with T2D.Using data from the UK Biobank, we found that levels of circulating LDL-C were negatively associated with T2D prevalence (odds ratio 0.41 [95% CI 0.39, 0.43] per mmol/L unit of LDL-C), despite positive associations of circulating LDL-C with HbA 1c and BMI.We then performed the first genome-wide exploration of variants simultaneously associated with lower circulating LDL-C and increased T2D risk, using data on LDL-C from the UK Biobank (n 5 431,167) and the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (n 5 188,577), and data on T2D from the Diabetes Genetics Replication and Meta-Analysis consortium (n 5 898,130).We identified 31 loci associated with lower circulating LDL-C and increased T2D, capturing several potential mechanisms.Seven of these loci have previously been identified for this dual phenotype, and nine have previously been implicated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.These findings extend our current understanding of the higher T2D risk among individuals with low circulating LDL-C and of the underlying mechanisms, including those responsible for the diabetogenic effect of LDL-C-lowering medications.Lipid-lowering medications, in particular from the statin drug class, are effective at lowering levels of circulating LDL-C and rates of adverse cardiovascular events (4) but convey an increased T2D risk (odds ratio [OR] 1.09) (5,6) in a dose-dependent manner (7).This increased risk, however, is outweighed at a population level by the cardiovascular event rate reduction.An increased T2D risk has also been reported in observational studies.Individuals with low levels of circulating LDL-C (e.g., ,60 mg/dL) exhibit a higher risk of prevalent and incident T2D (8,9), and among individuals with coronary disease, LDL-C and T2D are inversely related (10).In addition, individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia exhibit a decreased risk of T2D as well as lower BMI and triglyceride (TG) levels (11).",
      "HypercholesterolemiaHyperlipidemia in the form of elevated cholesterol is among the most common medical disorder seen in individuals above the age of 40 years.Statins are the most widely obvserved drug class directed at lowering serum cholesterol.Statin drugs act by inhibiting HGM-CoA reductase activity and are among the most effective cholesterol-lowering agents available [156][157][158].However, there is a degree of variability in the response to statins among patients.Genetic variation at the APOE locus has been associated with plasma lipoprotein concentrations in both fasting and postprandial states [159].In this regard, APOE E2 carriers have been reported to be more responsive to lipid-lowering therapies [160].Differential response to statin medications has also been reported in relation to the patient's genotype status of the cholesteryl ester transfer gene [161], -fibrinogen gene [162] and lipoprotein lipase gene [163].Likewise, the ApoE protein has been associated with late-onset and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) [164,165].However, in a study comparing influence of APOE genotype with clinical response to tacrine (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor), approximately two-thirds of the APOE E4 carriers presented ADAS scores that were worse compared with baseline levels [165].Whether ApoE will become clinically relevant in predicting response to AD therapy in the treatment of AD remains to be seen.",

      "In 1925, Keilin (188) discovered cytochromes in aerobic cells.He concluded that there are three distinct pigments, which he called cytochromes a, b, and c, and that they underwent oxidation-reduction changes in a determined sequence, which bridges dehydrogenase discovered by Wieland (414) and oxygenase by Warburg (407), leading to the concept of the respiratory chain.NADH + Flavoprotein -+ Cytochromes b +c+a+a3+OzDuring 1940 -1950s extensive studies identified mitochondria as centers of energy metabolism.In 1950-1960s studies on isolated mitochondria had clarified gross structure and bioenergetics of the respiratory chain that produces most of bioenergy in a cell.Mitochondria carry out the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the P-oxidation pathway for fatty acids.These degradative sequences essentially remove hydrogen from metabolic fuels with the release of CO2 and transfer it through coenzymic carrier to the respiratory chain in the mitochondrial inner membrane.The chain passes the electrons sequentially through complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) or complex II (succinate dehydrogenase), coenzyme Q (CoQ), complex III (ubiquinol: cytochrome c oxidoreductase), cytochrome c, and complex IV (cytochrome oxidase) to oxygen to give water, as schematically illustrated in Figure 1.The released energy is used to pump protons out of the mitochondrial inner membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient.The energy stored in this gradient is the driving force for complex V (ATP synthetase), which is also associated with the inner membrane, to condense ADP and Pi to make ATP.From the above mechanism of oxygen reduction, a large quantity of ROS is expected to generate from the genetically defected active sites of cytochrome oxidase and/or cytochrome b, or with too much oxygen supply over enzymic capability to dispose ROS.For example, the cytochrome oxidase subunit II is assessed as the binding site of cytochrome c.Hence, lack of the subunit II, which is commonly detected in the patients with mitochondrial myopathy (379), with KSS (241), or with MERRF (218), inevitably results in the decreased binding capacity cytochrome c to the oxidase, namely, the increased Michaelis constant (K,) of cytochrome c, leading to enhanced reduction of the respiratory chain at cytochrome b region and complex I, from where ROS production will explode similar to the ischemia-reperfusion episode of heart.All the patients harboring severe point mutations in the cytochrome oxidase subunit genes or in the cytochrome b gene expressed most severe clinical phenotype (280); for instance, a recipient of heart transplantation at age 7 (283) or a case of fatal infantile cardiomyopathy died at age 1 (291).A greater magnitude of ROS is produced by isolated mitochondria exposed to hyperbaric oxygen (36) or in vivo reperfusion of ischemic heart (204,267).The histochemical examination of biopsied hepatic tron transfer carriers and coupling ATPase, with a direct conversion of promitochondria to respiratory functional organelles (398).Promitochondria look clearly identifiable as normal mitochondria, having a normal outer membrane and an inner membrane with poorly developed cristae.Hence, a correlation between mitochondrial morphology and human aging would be expected not in the gross structure, but in histochemical demonstration of mtDNA encoded enzymes.cells (386) revealed no distinct difference with age in the activity of succinate dehydrogenase that is encoded bY nuclear gene.In contrast, mtDNA-encoded cytochrome oxidase (complex IV) in 1 40 autopsied hearts revealed randomly distributed cardiomyocytes without enzyme activity (254).The expression of the defect was independent of an underlying heart disease, but age was a discriminating factor.The defects occurred sporadically in the second decad .e but were regularly present from the sixth decade on.The results indicate that cytochrom .eoxidasedeficient heart muscle cells represent a degenerative lesion associated with cellular aging and may be involved Concerning number and size of mitochondria with aging, Tauchi and Sato (386) carried out an extensive survey of area and circumference of mitochondria of the in the reduction of myocardial contractile ability in senescence.Similarly, histochemical activity of cytochrome oxidase in limb muscle and in diaphragm (255) revealed randomly distributed muscle fibers without the enzyme activity, in contrast to normal histochemical reactivity for succinate dehydrogenase.A histochemical analysis of in diaphragmatic muscles from 49 subjects of different ages (54) demonstrated respiratory failure (cytochrome oxidase negativity) in occasional fibers from the fourth decade on with an -lo-fold increase between the fourth and ninth decade (from 0.16 to 2.85%).It thus had been a matter of great interest to discover why cytochrome oxidase has not been shown to generate significant amounts of such intermediates.On the basis of optical studies of oxy-and peroxy-cytochrome oxidase by Chance et al. ( 63), it became clear that the intermediates of oxygen reduction remain within the active site of cytochrome oxidase until the final reaction stage of water is achieved, probably for protection against cellular intoxication.From general properties of the mitochondrial generation of HzOz and effect of hyperbaric oxygen, it was postulated (36) that besides the well-known flavin reaction, formation of HZOZ may be due to interaction with an energy-dependent component of the respiratory chain at the cytochrome b level.These findings clearly indicated that the active sites of the complex IV and III, consisting of cytochromes a and b, respectively, play a crucial role not only for the cellular energy production, but also for protection against cellular oxidative damage.Hence, attenuation of the active sites, even low absolute level, could result in serious outcome in cellular viability.This point, however, has been not well recognized by the researchers until recently.",
