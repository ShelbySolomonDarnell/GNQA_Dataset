    "During stressful experiences, our brains release hormones such as epinephrine, glucocorticoids, and corticosterone. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis also plays a significant role in this process, stimulating the release of these hormones.",
    "Corticosterone, a type of glucocorticoid, is used in the body's response to stress. It initiates metabolic and physiological responses that help the body cope with stressors. It also provides negative feedback to inhibit activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which helps to dampen stress-activated defense reactions, including immune responses. Additionally, corticosterone can influence the expression of certain cytokines, potentially having anti-inflammatory effects."

      "CRH-expressing neurons located in the PVN of the hypothalamus play a pivotal role in orchestrating thecentral stress response. CRH stimulates the release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary gland. In turn, ACTH acts on the adrenal cortex to increase the production andrelease of GC hormones. Proper functioning of all of these neurons is essential formaintaining a homeostatic state following a stressful event. Several neuronal pathways modulate HPA axis activity. For example, the hippocampus and prefrontalcortex inhibit the HPA axis, and the amygdala and monoaminergic input from thebrainstem stimulate CRH production by PVN neurons.Norepinephrinergic activation leadsto afferent catecholaminergic signaling from the NTS and ventrolateral medulla tothe periventricular nucleus (PVN) [52], which in turn activates the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis. Thus, activation of stress response systems is initiated, which assists in directing mood and behavior. Blood-borne cytokines are also known to produce a central response by acting oncytokine receptors within the brain. However, given their size and hydrophilicnature, trafcking to the brain was once considered to be isolated to circumventricular organs. In 1983, Blatteis et al.They havedetermined that psychological stress results in decreased hippocampal neurogenesisalongside signicant increases in hippocampal IL-1b protein, depressive-likebehavior, and ACTH and corticosterone release [169, 170]. The importance of IL-1in producing these behavioral and HPA axis outcomes was conrmed both genetically using IL-1r knockout mice and pharmacologically using IL-1ra. In IL-1R1knockout mice stress-induced brain, behavioral and endocrine perturbationsobserved in the wild-type mice were all attenuated [169, 170]. More importantly,these perturbations were abolished if wild-type mice were adrenalectomized [170].Koo JW, Duman RS (2008) IL-1beta is an essential mediator of the antineurogenic and anhedonic effects of stress.

      "The glucocorticoids, cortisol in humans and corticosterone in most rodents, have numerous metabolic and physiological effects andprovide negative feedback to inhibit HPA activity at the level of the pituitary, PVN,hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and other brain areas [142144]. Glucocorticoids,acting on their receptors (mineralocorticoid receptors, MR; glucocorticoid receptors, GR), initiate metabolic and physiological responses that facilitate response toand coping with the stressor and, ultimately, dampen stress-activated defense reactions, including immune responses, to prevent them from overshooting and themselves causing harm [145, 146].In the short term, the metabolic and physiologicalchanges induced by the glucocorticoids promote survival (increased gluconeogenesis and blood pressure, suppressed immune and reproductive function). However,prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids can result in metabolic, cognitive, andimmune dysfunction [147]. Thus, it is important that the HPA axis be tightlycontrolled through efcient feedback and efcient termination of the stress response;the ability to turn off the stress response is as important as the ability to respondinitially [145].[45, 54] or by injection of glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitors [58] enhances theexpression of IL-1 and other cytokines in brain as a result of stress exposure. Thesendings parallel earlier studies showing that ADX enhanced the plasma IL-6response evoked by exposure to a novel environment [78] and t with the canonicalviewpoint that glucocorticoids have powerful anti-inammatory properties. Whilewe do not wish to dispute this viewpoint, it is interesting to note that antiinammatory actions of CORT are most pronounced at high and supraphysiologicalconcentrations, whereas lower concentrations of CORT appear to have someimmune-potentiating effects (e.g. , [6]).As such, an immunological stressor, such as infection or a mimetic such asLPS which works to activate the HPA axis, will result in downstream glucocorticoidrelease. This secretion of glucocorticoids should, in turn, attenuate the originatinginammation. However, this is often not the case when studying for patients ofdepression showing enhanced immune activation, and hence, additional processesmust also be at play such as the proinammatory nature of cytokines and glucocorticoid resistance (discussed below). It is important to recognize that cytokine regulation of HPA axis function is complex and requires a multifaceted approach to studying such complexity.CORT, on the other hand, appears to negatively inuence the expression of IL-1 and other cytokines throughinteraction with glucocorticoid responsive elements (GREs) in the promoter region of cytokine genes. There are also reciprocal interactions between NE andCORT, whereby NE is a key driver in central regulation of the HPA axis (via a1-adrenergic receptors) and CORT tempers the release of NE.[45] also demonstrated the profound impact of endogenous CORT to inhibit brain cytokine responses evoked by stress, showing that boththe magnitude and spatial distribution of IL-1 changes provoked by stress wereaugmented in ADX rats. Since then, our lab and others have gone on to successfullyexamine cytokine expression using gross dissections and ELISA detection (e.g. ,[22, 5557]) or at the level of gene expression using RT-PCR [5861], whichtogether further support the view that stress challenges have the ability to drivecytokine changes in the uninjured brain.The HPA axis has been shown to regulate immune responses. The main hormones involved in the HPA axis are corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), andglucocorticoids (GC), which are also called stress hormones. These hormones contribute to the regulation of immune responses and can also affect neuronal survival,neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and behavioral responses [1, 2]. The HPA axis isa three-tiered biological system that begins at the highest level with the release ofCRH from the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN).Whether these low-dose facilitation effectsrelate more directly to the timing of CORT injection relative to cytokine measurements, or represent differential tissue sensitivity to glucocorticoids, remains to bedetermined [79, 80]. Moreover, ambient levels of CORT taken during or immediately after stress exposure do not appear to be predictive of central IL-1 expression[63, 65]. Regardless, the point here is that the long-held assumption that glucocorticoids exert unilateral, anti-inammatory actions does not broadly account for theliterature writ large.During theresolution phase of disease, hormone levels did not differ among the three prenatalgroups, and if anything, corticosterone and ACTH levels were somewhat lower inPAE compared to control animals with clinical signs of arthritis. It has been suggested [227] that low levels of glucocorticoid hormones in the context of high levelsof inammation may reect a disconnect between the immune and endocrine systems. As noted above, we have evidence for such a disconnect in our previous work.As such, CORT can interfere with IL-1 gene expression (and expression of othercytokines) through numerous pathways. When taken together, a simple framework for understanding the interactionbetween the major stress-responsive systems (SNS and HPA axis) and inammatoryconsequences of stress is that neuroinammatory consequences of stress are mechanistically intertwined between the stimulatory actions of the SNS and the inhibitoryactions of CORT (see [84] for a review), though much work remains to be done inthis area. This concept is depicted in Fig.The HPA response is slower, and the secretion of the glucocorticoid hormones initiates numerous metabolic and behavioral effects that mediateeffective coping with a stressor in the longer term. The HPA and autonomic systemsappear to be regulated by similar neurotransmitters (e.g. , acetylcholine, serotonin,norepinephrine, GABA). In addition, there is reciprocal stimulation of HPA andautonomic activity by CRH and norepinephrine and reciprocal actions of the glucocorticoids and catecholamines. The glucocorticoids are thought to feed back torestrain activity of both systems. Further, the activity and sensitivity of both systemsare modulated by stress and circadian inuences [140].Regardless, the evidence todate suggests that NE release is a key driver of inammatory processes in at leastsome brain structures during times of stress. In contrast to the actions of NE, which appear to stimulate the expression of IL-1and other cytokines, CORT appears to constrain cytokine gene and protein expression during times of stress, at least in broad strokes. Indeed, there is a plethora ofstudies demonstrating that removal of endogenous glucocorticoids through ADX142T. Deak et al.With that said, there are a variety of cellular mechanisms by which glucocorticoids impact gene expression for cytokines during times of stress, particularly in thecase of IL-1 gene expression. Many of these effects are produced through interaction of the CORT-receptor complex with repressor sites in the promoter region ofthe IL-1 gene, including the nGRE repressor site and interference with nuclear factor k-light chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) signaling. In addition, CORThas been shown to block cAMP response element-binding (CREB) phosphorylation, prevent NFkB binding to the DNA, and destabilize mRNA for IL-1 [8183].Similarly,paradigms involving neonatal immune activation have demonstrated increased propensities to develop stress-related behaviors alongside hypersecretion of corticosterone, elevated hippocampal cytokines, and altered GR abundance in adulthood[184186]. Such animal studies have been useful in dissociating the relationshipbetween the actions of cytokines and the HPA axis in the brain to provide a moredirect account of how these factors may inuence behavior. Raz Yirmiyas laboratory has been particularly inuential in this regard, reporting brain IL-1b to beresponsible for depressive-like behavior in relation to stress physiology.",
