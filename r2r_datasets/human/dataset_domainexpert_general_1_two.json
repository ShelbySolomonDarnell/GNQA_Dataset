    "The genes that give a predisposition to developing T1D include the HLA class II genes, the insulin locus (INS) VNTR on 11p15, the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) locus on 2q31, the PTPN22 gene on 1p13, and the interleukin 2 receptor alpha (IL2RA) on 10p15. Other genes associated with T1D include those in the HLA region on chromosome 6, specifically HLA alleles DR3-DQ2 or DR4-DQ8, and alleles at HLA-DQB1.",

      "A. Genetic ScreeningWe have discussed above the genetic component of T1D.The genetic susceptibility to T1D is determined by genes related to immune function with the potential exception of the insulin gene (434).The genetic susceptibility component of T1D allows some targeting of primary preventive care to family members of diagnosed T1D patients, but there is no complete inheritance of the disease.Nevertheless, the risk for developing T1D compared with people with no family history is 10 -15 times greater.Although 70% of individuals with T1D carry defined risk-associated genotypes at the HLA locus, only 3-7% of the carriers of such genetic risk markers develop diabetes (3).II. THE GENETICS OF TYPE 1 DIABETESA comprehensive overview of genetic data in mouse and human is beyond the scope of this article.Instead, we will focus on how the various susceptibility genes and environmental triggers can fit in a mechanistic model for T1D etiology.",
      "T1D risk is strongly influenced by multiple genetic loci and as yet poorly understood environmental factors.The disease is highly heritable, with first-degree relatives of cases displaying approximately 15 times greater risk than the general population.Concordance in monozygotic twins is also as high as 50%.A number of genetic determinants of T1D had already been established before the era of genome-wide association studies.The strongest genetic factors include the HLA class II genes, encoding highly polymorphic antigen-presenting proteins that account for almost 50% of the genetic risk for T1D.Other established loci confer more modest, but substantial effects, such as the insulin locus (INS) VNTR on 11p15 [44][45][46][47], the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) locus on 2q31 [48][49][50][51] and the PTPN22 gene on 1p13 [52,53].More recently, convincing statistical support for an additional T1D susceptibility locus on 10p15 harboring the interleukin 2 receptor alpha (IL2RA) was uncovered, utilizing non-coding SNPs [54][55][56].However, the majority of other associations in the pre-GWA era remain controversial [57][58][59], and linkage studies have established the fact that there are no other loci with an effect size approaching that of HLA.",
      "Clearly genetics play an important role in the T1D disease process as both MZ and DZ twins have the same environmental exposures but different concordance rates and length to diagnosis of the second twin.Numerous genes have been associated with T1D, the most significant being the HLA region on chromosome 6 [6].More than 90% of type 1 diabetics carry HLA alleles DR3-DQ2 or DR4-DQ8 compared to no more than 40% of the general population [7].Alleles at HLA-DQB1 are known to be, in part, protective [8].Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are also associated with T1D.A recent genome-wide association study of approximately 2,000 patients with each of 7 common, chronic diseases, including T1D, and 7,000 shared controls confirmed the association of SNPs in 5 previously identified regions with T1D and discovered 5 novel associations.However, the authors concluded that these regions, with the exception of the HLA on chromosome 6, confer only modest effects on T1D, and ''the association signals so far identified account for only a small proportion of overall familiality'' [9].These results suggest that additional genetic variants contribute to inheritance of T1D.Type 1 diabetes (T1D) tends to cluster in families, suggesting there may be a genetic component predisposing to disease.However, a recent large-scale genome-wide association study concluded that identified genetic factors, single nucleotide polymorphisms, do not account for overall familiality.Another class of genetic variation is the amplification or deletion of .1 kilobase segments of the genome, also termed copy number variations (CNVs).We performed genome-wide CNV analysis on a cohort of 20 unrelated adults with T1D and a control (Ctrl) cohort of 20 subjects using the Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 in combination with the Birdsuite copy number calling software.We identified 39 CNVs as enriched or depleted in T1D versus Ctrl.Additionally, we performed CNV analysis in a group of 10 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T1D.Eleven of these 39 CNVs were also respectively enriched or depleted in the Twin cohort, suggesting that these variants may be involved in the development of islet autoimmunity, as the presently unaffected twin is at high risk for developing islet autoimmunity and T1D in his or her lifetime.These CNVs include a deletion on chromosome 6p21, near an HLA-DQ allele.CNVs were found that were both enriched or depleted in patients with or at high risk for developing T1D.These regions may represent genetic variants contributing to development of islet autoimmunity in T1D.Type 1 diabetes (T1D) tends to cluster in families, suggesting there may be a genetic component predisposing to disease.However, a recent large-scale genome-wide association study concluded that identified genetic factors, single nucleotide polymorphisms, do not account for overall familiality.Another class of genetic variation is the amplification or deletion of .1 kilobase segments of the genome, also termed copy number variations (CNVs).We performed genome-wide CNV analysis on a cohort of 20 unrelated adults with T1D and a control (Ctrl) cohort of 20 subjects using the Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 in combination with the Birdsuite copy number calling software.We identified 39 CNVs as enriched or depleted in T1D versus Ctrl.Additionally, we performed CNV analysis in a group of 10 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T1D.Eleven of these 39 CNVs were also respectively enriched or depleted in the Twin cohort, suggesting that these variants may be involved in the development of islet autoimmunity, as the presently unaffected twin is at high risk for developing islet autoimmunity and T1D in his or her lifetime.These CNVs include a deletion on chromosome 6p21, near an HLA-DQ allele.CNVs were found that were both enriched or depleted in patients with or at high risk for developing T1D.These regions may represent genetic variants contributing to development of islet autoimmunity in T1D.",
      "Background: The immune system matures mainly during the postnatal period through breastfeeding, and is partly modified by nutritive factors.The manner by which early feeding practices influence the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus (TID) is not clear.Also the use of genetics in prognostic evaluation of the disease has not be studied intensely. Aim:To study the relationship between early infant feeding patterns and susceptibility to TID through the HLA-DRB1 and DQ allelic polymorphism and identify the genes of high predictive value in the prognostic model. Methods:The study included 24 diabetic children with TID matched with 21 controls.All the children were exposed to detailed history of the disease process and anthropometry for weight, height and body mass index.Blood samples were collected from all 45 cases for measuring HLA-DRB1and HLA-DQB1allelic polymorphism for the susceptible genes of HLA-DRB1 0301, 0302, 0401 and 0402 and HLA-DQB1*02 and for the protective genes HLA-DRB1 07,*13 by polymerase chain reaction sequence specific primer (PCR-SSP) done by genomic DNA extraction using Genomic DNA purification kits.Results: Allelic polymorphism for the susceptible genes of HLA-DRB1 were shown to be higher in the diabetic group compared to the control group especially for the 0302 and 0401 alleles at P<0.05, but was not significant for HLA-DRB1-0301 and 0402 at P>0.05.HLADRB1*07 and HLADRB1*13 were significantly higher in the breastfed healthy but not in the diseased or the formula fed groups (p<0.001)(p<0.05).The detection of HLADRB1 0401 allele was more with retinopathy and HLADRB1 0301 allele with microalbuminuria. Conclusions:The absence of protective genes is a strong predictor of TID.Susceptibility genes are influenced by early feeding patterns and in turn affect the clinical course of the disease that could be of prognostic value in TID.",
      "More than 60 susceptibility loci have been identified (Table 1).The greatest genetic risk (50%) for T1D is conferred by alterations to immune genes, especially those encoding the classical HLAs (Ounissi-Benkalha and Polychronakos, 2008).Other genetic loci (Table 1) are believed to influence population-level risk for T1D, although it is poorly understood how these non-HLA loci contribute to disease susceptibility (Ram et al., 2016a).The genetics of type 1 diabetesThere is a strong genetic risk to T1D.This is exemplified by (Redondo et al., 2001) who demonstrated a strong concordance of genetic inheritance (65%) and T1D susceptibility in monozygotic twin pairs.That is, when one sibling is afflicted, there is a high probability that the other twin will develop T1D by the age of 60 years.Additionally, autoantibody positivity and islet destruction was observed after a prospective long-term follow-up of monozygotic twins of patients with T1D, despite initial disease-discordance among the twins (Redondo et al., 2008).",
      "Family and twin studies indicate that a substantial fraction of susceptibility to type 1 diabetes is attributable to genetic factors.These and other epidemiologic studies also implicate environmental factors as important triggers.Although the specific environmental factors that contribute to immune-mediated diabetes remain unknown, several of the relevant genetic factors have been identified using two main approaches: genome-wide linkage analysis and candidate gene association studies.This article reviews the epidemiology of type 1 diabetes, the relative merits of linkage and association studies, and the results achieved so far using these two approaches.Prospects for the future of type 1 diabetes genetics research are considered.Family and twin studies indicate that a substantial fraction of susceptibility to type 1 diabetes is attributable to genetic factors.These and other epidemiologic studies also implicate environmental factors as important triggers.Although the specific environmental factors that contribute to immune-mediated diabetes remain unknown, several of the relevant genetic factors have been identified using two main approaches: genome-wide linkage analysis and candidate gene association studies.This article reviews the epidemiology of type 1 diabetes, the relative merits of linkage and association studies, and the results achieved so far using these two approaches.Prospects for the future of type 1 diabetes genetics research are considered.",
      "CONCLUSIONThe greatest genetic risk (both increased risk, susceptible, and decreased risk, protective) for type 1 diabetes is conferred by specific alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes of the HLA class II (and class I) genes.There are currently about 50 non-HLA region loci that also affect the type 1 diabetes risk.Many of the assumed functions of the non-HLA genes of interest suggest that variants at these loci act in concert on the adaptive and innate immune systems to initiate, magnify, and perpetuate -cell destruction.The clues that genetic studies provide will eventually help lead us to identify how -cell destruction is influenced by environmental factors.While there is extensive overlap between type 1 diabetes and other immune-mediated diseases, it appears that type 1 and type 2 diabetes are genetically distinct entities.These observations may suggest ways to help identify causal gene(s) and, ultimately, a set of disease-associated variants defined on specific haplotypes.Unlike other complex human diseases, relatively little familial clustering remains to be explained for type 1 diabetes.The remaining missing heritability for type 1 diabetes is likely to be explained by as yet unmapped common variants, rare variants, structural polymorphisms, and gene-gene and/or gene-environmental interactions, in which we can expect epigenetic effects to play a role.The examination of the type 1 diabetes genes and their pathways may reveal the earliest pathogenic mechanisms that result in the engagement of the innate and adaptive immune systems to produce massive -cell destruction and clinical disease.The resources established by the international T1DGC are available to the research community and provide a basis for future discovery of genes that regulate the earliest events in type 1 diabetes etiology-potential targets for intervention or biomarkers for monitoring the effects and outcomes of potential therapeutic agents.",
      "IntroductionOver 60 loci in the genome contribute to genetic predisposition to type 1 diabetes (T1D) [1][2][3][4][5] in which insulin deficiency results from an autoimmune attack against insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreatic islets.Heterogeneity in the disease aetiology is recently acknowledged and immunological processes leading to T1D in individuals diagnosed later in life appear different from the processes in individuals having disease onset in early childhood, in which B cells are involved in the pathological process in the pancreas [5].Different genes and genetic variants may thus affect disease course at varying ages, also suggested by the high diagnosis age correlation (r 2 = 0.95) in Finnish monozygotic twins concordant for T1D [6].Of the known T1D risk loci, however, only the HLA locus and a few non-HLA loci, have been associated with age at diagnosis [7][8][9][10].Genetic risk score combines risk-increasing alleles into a single score and the genetic risk score for T1D has already been suggested for clinical use for screening of infants at highest T1D risk [11].All disease-susceptibility variants are included in the score, but only a few known T1D variants have stronger effects in individuals with early-onset disease [10].Genes affecting type 1 diabetes diagnosis age / A.

      "The risk for T1D is strongly influenced by multiple genetic loci and environmental factors.The disease is heritable, with first-degree relatives of patients with T1D being at 15-fold greater risk for developing the condition than the general population.",
      "Type 1 DiabetesThe higher type 1 diabetes prevalence observed in relatives implies a genetic risk, and the degree of genetic identity with the proband correlates with risk (22)(23)(24)(25)(26). Gene variants in one major locus, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) (27), confer 50-60% of the genetic risk by affecting HLA protein binding to antigenic peptides and antigen presentation to T cells (28).Approximately 50 additional genes individually contribute smaller effects (25,29).These contributors include gene variants that modulate immune regulation and tolerance (30)(31)(32)(33), variants that modify viral responses (34,35), and variants that influence responses to environmental signals and endocrine function (36), as well as some that are expressed in pancreatic b-cells (37).Genetic influences on the triggering of islet autoimmunity and disease progression are being defined in relatives (38,39).Together, these gene variants explain ;80% of type 1 diabetes heritability.Epigenetic (40), gene expression, and regulatory RNA profiles (36) may vary over time and reflect disease activity, providing a dynamic readout of risk.",

      "Genetics. T1DM is a polygenic disease that is influ enced by environmental factors.Genetic risk factors are necessary but not sufficient for disease, as their pene trance is low.The concordance rate of T1DM among monozygotic twins is reported to be only 30%, although a recent study that involved longterm followup suggested that this percentage might be higher 47,48 .",
      "Presently, 48 other genomic regions, referred to as susceptibility regions, have been found to also confer susceptibility to T1D (Burren et al., 2011;Steck and Rewers, 2011;Yang et al., 2011;Bluestone et al. 2010;Poicot et al., 2010;Todd et al., 2010;Todd et al., 2007).But their contribution is minimal in comparison to the HLA locus (Gillespie, 2014).Also, research has shown that less than 10% of individuals with HLA-conferred diabetes susceptibility actually progress to clinical disease (Knip andSiljandera, 2008, Wenzlau et al., 2008).This implies that additional factors are needed to trigger and drive -cell destruction in genetically predisposed persons (Knip and Siljandera, 2008).Environmental factors are believed to influence the expression of T1D.The reason being that in the case of identical twins, if one twin has T1D, the other twin only has it 30%-50% of the time, despite having the same genome.This means that other factors contribute to the prevalence or onset of this disease (Knip et al., 2005)."
