There is a retrieval augmented generation system, called GNQA, that holds a corpus of 3000 research documents. The documents span the topics of research related to genenetwork.org, research about the genetics and genomics of diabetes and aging. The systems topics will be referred to as GN, aging, and sugah. Two types of individuals query GNQA, citizen scientists and domain experts. A citizen scientist is someone with no more than undergraduate level understanding of biology and is someone who did not major or minor in biology.
