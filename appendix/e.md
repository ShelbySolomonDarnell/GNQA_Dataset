#### Version 1
Good morning name​,

I am Solomon Darnell, a GGI postdoc, and am working on a manuscript on a retrieval augmented generation system to support system genetics research on Genenetwork.org, and I request your feedback on the systems' responses. 
Our system has a corpus of approximately 3000 research publications focused on three topics: research related to/utilizing the GeneNetwork.org platform, research on the genetics/genomics of aging, and research on the genetics/genomics of diabetes.

We ask that you:
1 - visit QA.GENENETWORK.ORG
2 - login using 
3 - select the *GNQA Search* link to the right of the main search bar
4 - submit the following 5 queries to the system and rate its responses
5 - come up with 5 of your own (within the confines of the given corpus topics: genenetwork, aging, diabetes) queries for the system and rate the responses

Five questions we ask that you submit to the system and rate:
1. Create a how-to guide for genetic sequencing.
2.  What is the significance of the length of telomeres?
3. Once a sperm combines with an egg, what determines how traits are passed onto the resulting lifeform?
4. Why is genetic tracing matrilineal rather than patrilineal?
5. How does one tell the difference between X and Y DNA, with respect to DNA tracing and determining QTLs?

#### Version 2

Subject: Help me with my research, can you ask and rate a few questions?

Greetings name​,

I am Dr. Solomon Darnell and am working on a computational biology manuscript with Dr. Pjotr Prins.

We are writing the results and we need testers for our retrieval augmented generation system.
We request your feedback on the systems' responses. 
Our system has a corpus of approximately 3000 research publications focused on three topics: research related to/utilizing the GeneNetwork.org platform, research on the genetics/genomics of aging, and research on the genetics/genomics of diabetes.

5 - come up with 5 of your own (within the confines of the given corpus topics: genenetwork, aging, diabetes) queries for the system and rate the responses
6 - upon completing the system testing, kindly reply to this email with your level of formal biology training (high school, undergraduate, graduate, prof)

Five questions we ask that you submit to the system and rate:
* Create a how-to guide for genetic sequencing.
