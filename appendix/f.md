# Appendix F - Informed Consent for Pwani University in Kilifi, Kenya volunteers

Good morning [name],

I am Dr. Solomon Darnell, an AI genetics researcher at University of Tennessee Health Science Center, and am working on a manuscript on a retrieval augmented generation system to support system genetics research on Genenetwork.org (GN), and I request your feedback on the systems' responses.
Our system has a corpus of approximately 3000 research publications focused on three topics: research related to/utilizing the GeneNetwork.org platform, research on the genetics/genomics of aging, and research on the genetics/genomics of diabetes.

As a bioinformatics masters student at Pwani I request your support and in return offer you support in research ideation. If you have an idea on how to improve this research or want to use/build a similar system, we can discuss and hopefully work together.

We ask that you, by 5pm EAT Tuesday 21 May 2024:
1 - visit QA.GENENETWORK.ORG
2 - login using user -> pwani\_bioinf\_XX@pu.ac.ke, pass -> 

3 - select the *GNQA Search* link to the right of the main search bar
4 - submit the following 5 queries to the system and rate its responses
5 - come up with 5 of your own (within the confines of the given corpus topics: GN, aging, diabetes) queries for the system and rate the responses

Five questions we ask that you submit to the system and rate:
* Create a how-to guide for genetic sequencing.
* What is the significance of the length of telomeres?
* Once a sperm combines with an egg, what determines how traits are passed onto the resulting lifeform?
* Why is genetic tracing matrilineal rather than patrilineal?
* How does one tell the difference between X and Y DNA, with respect to DNA tracing and determining QTLs?

You are appreciated,
SSD
