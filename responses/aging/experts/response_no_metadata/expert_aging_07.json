The intrinsic decline in function that occurs during ageing appears to be caused by the accumulation of damage, particularly at the molecular level.As far as we know, no genes have evolved specifically because they cause damage to accumulate, and the evolution of ageing can therefore be understood only as a side-effect of other causes of evolutionary change.The mechanisms by which ageing can evolve were first elucidated by J.B.S. Haldane [14], P.B. Medawar [15] and G.C. Williams [16].Extrinsic hazards from disease, predation and accidents mean that even potentially immortal organisms will die.Genetic effects that become apparent only later in life encounter a reduced force of natural selection, because not all their bearers will survive to express them.Haldane pointed out that late-onset genetic diseases in humans, such as Huntington's disease, encounter only weak selection, because most reproduction is complete by the age of onset [14].Ageing could therefore result from the accumulation under mutation pressure of age-specific, deleterious mutations.In addition, if some mutations have pleiotropic effects, with beneficial effects in youth, such as high fecundity, but also with a higher subsequent rate of ageing, then they could be incorporated into the population by natural selection, which will act more strongly on the early, beneficial effect.Thus, variation in the rate of ageing would result from the readjustment of a tradeoff between youthful benefits and the subsequent rate of ageing.Both processes imply that faster ageing will evolve where the extrinsic hazard to adults is greatest, a hypothesis in general supported by the data [1,2,17]."
