[15] identified only five genes with age-associated expression in LCLs, including p53 itself (TP53).Although the authors attribute the lack of age-affected genes to their small sample size (n=50) and narrow age range, our analysis with a much larger sample size found even fewer age-related changes, suggesting a lack of detectable aging signature in LCLs.The analysis in the subset of fresh lymphocytes suggested an age influence in fresh lymphocytes may potentially be detectable with a larger sample size."

                    "text": "\n\nGenetic studies have shown that aging can be slowed in mutants that are defective in a wide range of cellular processes (such as mitochondrial function, chromatin regulation, insulin signaling, transcriptional regulation, and genome stability).This indicates that aging is a complex process driven by diverse molecular pathways and biochemical events.As such, a powerful approach to study aging is to use systems biology, which allows a multitude of factors affecting aging to be analyzed in parallel.For example, DNA microarrays and gene expression chips have been used to perform a genome-wide analysis of changes in gene expres-sion in old age.Extensive studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have identified hundreds of ageregulated genes (Hill et al. 2000;Zou et al. 2000;Lund et al. 2002;Pletcher et al. 2002;Murphy et al. 2003).Several studies have described age-regulated genes in the muscle and brain of mice (Lee et al. 1999(Lee et al. , 2000) ) and the retina and muscle of humans (Yoshida et al. 2002;Welle et al. 2003Welle et al. , 2004).These age-regulated genes may serve as markers of aging, enabling one to assess physiological age independently of chronological age.Analysis of the functions of these age-regulated genes has identified specific biochemical mechanisms that change toward the end of life."
