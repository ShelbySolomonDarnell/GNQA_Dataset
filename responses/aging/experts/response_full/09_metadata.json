G. Dobzhansky asserts that \"nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. \"Evolution primarily maximizes fitness of individuals of reproductive age.The classical evolutionary biological theory of aging claims that aging occurs because of decline in the force of natural selection with age (Kirkwood and Austad 2000).Then, according to that theory, aging-related (senescent) phenotypes with post-reproductive manifestation are non-adaptive and subject to stochastic variation.Therefore, at a first glance evolution should not be relevant to senescent phenotypes (apart so-called grandmother hypothesis; Hawkes et al. 1998).Such phenotypes, however, can be caused by reproductive-age-related risk factors making, thus, evolution to be relevant to them (Vijg and Suh 2005;Di Rienzo and Hudson 2005;Drenos and Kirkwood 2010)."

G. Dobzhansky asserts that \"nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. \"Evolution primarily maximizes fitness of individuals of reproductive age.The classical evolutionary biological theory of aging claims that aging occurs because of decline in the force of natural selection with age (Kirkwood and Austad 2000).Then, according to that theory, aging-related (senescent) phenotypes with post-reproductive manifestation are non-adaptive and subject to stochastic variation.Therefore, at a first glance evolution should not be relevant to senescent phenotypes (apart so-called grandmother hypothesis; Hawkes et al. 1998).Such phenotypes, however, can be caused by reproductive-age-related risk factors making, thus, evolution to be relevant to them (Vijg and Suh 2005;Di Rienzo and Hudson 2005;Drenos and Kirkwood 2010)."
