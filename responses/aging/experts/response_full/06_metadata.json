Firstly, aging is a complex phenotype influenced by multiple genes and numerous different pathophysiological processes and diseases. Secondly, any common variation in genes associated with aging probably has a small effect, requiring large studies for identification. Thirdly, human studies face issues like environmental heterogeneity, genetic diversity, and lack of birth matched controls. Lastly, the influence of environmental factors and human-specific confounders like psychosocial, economic, and cultural factors can potentially mask purely biological aging mechanisms, making the analysis more difficult.",
