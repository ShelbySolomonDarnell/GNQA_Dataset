(2018) using an impressive dataset consisting of hundreds of millions of historical individuals showed a similar heritability of lifespan.The study on the heritability of \"longevity\" performed in twins by Ljungquist et al. (1998) found that the heritability of longevity was higher in women and increased with advancing age.Some of the most interesting individuals that may shed reveal secrets of longevity originate from multigenerational, longevity-enriched families, since such families have propensity to be long-lived, but also seem to evade age-related morbidity.Several genealogical studies of long-lived families evidenced that parental longevity could be considered a proxy for lifespan.Long-lived parents have a high probability to beget long-lived offspring, which gives an indication that longevity is indeed heritable (van den Berg et al., 2017).Notably, members of longlived families have an interesting phenotype beyond extended lifespan, as they seem to be escaping or delaying age-related disease and show a compression of late life morbidity (extended healthspan).Unraveling the genetics of these individuals might help identifying novel mechanisms involved in healthy aging that can subsequently be targeted by therapeutic interventions.An important drawback of longevity research is the arbitrary age thresholds that often were used to signify an extreme age (Baghdadi et al., 2020).In the pre-GWAS era, the age-thresholds used to define longevity were relatively low (i.e., reaching an age above 80 or 85 years) and the sample size was limited.van den Berg et al. (2019) used two independent multi-generational genealogical datasets to determine the most optimal definition of longevity.They found that the strongest heritable component of longevity is present in individuals belonging to the top 10% survivors of their birth cohort with equally long-lived family members (reviewed in Baghdadi et al., 2020)."
