Lack of awareness and interest: Health professionals, governments, and researchers often lack awareness and interest in genetic diseases, which hinders progress.\n\n2. Limited funding and access to technology: Research funding is often limited, and access to high-end technology is not always available, which restricts the scope of research.\n\n3. Economic and health disparities: These disparities can affect the application and benefits of genomic medicine, making it less accessible to those in lower income brackets.\n\n4. Ethical, legal, and social issues: The interpretation, storage, and sharing of genetic data raise ethical and legal concerns, including issues of privacy and consent.\n\n5. Rapid advancements: The fast pace of developments in genetics and genomics can outpace the ability to address emerging ethical, legal, and social questions.\n\n6. Public knowledge and trust: There is a need to increase public knowledge about genomic research and address issues of trust in medicine and scientific research.\n\n7. Integration of genomics into public health: This is a major future challenge for healthcare systems, requiring dialogue with all stakeholders in society.",
