        "answer": "Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, has been shown to extend the lifespan of various organisms, including mice, by delaying or reversing aging in multiple cell types. It does this by regulating rates of protein synthesis and energy utilization, which are processes associated with aging. In the hematopoietic system, rapamycin limits age-related increases in stem cells and biomarkers of aging, enhancing the performance of these cells. However, rapamycin also has potential unwanted metabolic effects, such as insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, though these effects are controversial and potentially reversible. The mTOR pathway, which rapamycin targets, integrates signals from insulin, cytokines, nutrients, oxygen, and mitogenic stimuli, and its regulation has implications for longevity and against the negative effects of aging. Rapamycin also induces autophagy, a process important for cellular homeostasis and damage prevention. Despite these benefits, the exact mechanisms by which rapamycin extends lifespan and whether it delays aging or affects specific diseases remain unclear.",
