        "answer": "Gene-by-drug effects (GxD) can modulate life expectancies and health by influencing how individuals respond to medications. Genetic variations can affect how drugs are absorbed, disseminated, metabolized, and excreted in the body, which can lead to differences in drug efficacy and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions. For example, a genetic variant in the HMG-CoA reductase gene can modify the LDL-C response to pravastatin. Additionally, certain genes are involved in DNA damage repair and oxidative stress, which can influence susceptibility to adverse drug effects. Therefore, understanding these genetic variations can help in personalizing treatment and potentially improving health outcomes.",

[32] to give 222 genes involved in DNA damage repair.Sixty-five of these genes (approximately 25%) were found to be differentially expressed in the liver.Oxidative Stress genes were defined by 68 genes included in \"response to oxidative stress\" (IPA) of which 23 genes were differentially expressed (Table 1)."

[17 •• ] concluded that the proteins produced from the newly discovered genes, ABCG5 and ABCG8, were responsible for the regulated reverse transport of newly absorbed cholesterol and phytosterols out of the apical surface of intestinal cells.Using public gene databases, a human homolog of the putative mouse transporter was identified, cloned and used to screen sitosterolemic humans.Dysfunctional mutations were found in these genes in all individuals suffering from sitosterolemia.Thus, individuals suffering from sitosterolemia lack the machinery responsible for the selective and controlled transport of cholesterol, and therefore hyperabsorb various sterols (including plant sterols).This study illustrated many of the strengths of genomic experimentation: the identification of phenotypically important genes using global differential gene expression analysis; querying internet databases to deduce structure/function relationships from sequence comparison; and the characterization of individual variation (polymorphism) linked to health.These findings have transformed our understanding of lipid absorption and metabolism, begging the question: how long would this knowledge have waited to be discovered without genomics?"
