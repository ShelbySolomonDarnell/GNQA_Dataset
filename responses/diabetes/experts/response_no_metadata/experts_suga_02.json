        "answer": "Genomics provides a comprehensive understanding of the genetic factors influencing the development and progression of diabetes. Nutritional genomics focuses on the interaction between genes and dietary patterns, which plays a crucial role in diabetes. By studying gene-nutrient interactions and genetic variations, researchers can develop tailored diets that maximize the use of nutrients and other functional ingredients present in food, aiding in the prevention and delay of diabetes and its complications. Furthermore, genomics can help identify how an individual's genetic makeup can affect nutrient metabolism and response to nutrient intake, potentially leading to diabetes. Thus, genomics offers a promising approach to understanding the nutritional factors of diabetes and developing personalized dietary interventions.",
