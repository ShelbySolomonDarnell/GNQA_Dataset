In type 1 diabetes, gene variants in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus contribute to 50-60% of the genetic risk by affecting protein binding and antigen presentation to T cells. Other gene variants that modulate immune regulation, viral responses, environmental signals, and endocrine function also contribute to the disease. The risk for type 1 diabetes is strongly influenced by multiple genetic loci. In type 2 diabetes, many common variants, largely with small effect size, contribute to overall disease risk. Monogenic forms of diabetes, such as MODY, result from mutations in a single gene. Family history also plays a role, suggesting that genetics conveys more than heritable information; it probably includes non-genetic familial behaviors and norms.",

Gene tic S t udiesBecause of the uncertainty regarding the number and action of genes involved in type 1 diabetes, genetic studies have tended to focus on approaches that require few assumptions about the underlying model of disease risk.The two primary approaches have been linkage studies (using pairs of affected relatives, typically siblings) and association studies (using either case-control or family-based designs).Linkage studies using affected sibling pairs seek to identify regions of the genome that are shared"
