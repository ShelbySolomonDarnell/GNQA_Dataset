RESULTS-We confirmed the associations of TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, IGF2BP2, and FTO with risk for type 2 diabetes, with odds ratios ranging from 1.13 to 1.35 (1.3 ϫ 10 Ϫ12 Ͻ P unadjusted Ͻ 0.016).In addition, the A allele of rs8050136 at FTO was associated with increased BMI in the control subjects (P unadjusted ϭ 0.008).However, we did not observe significant association of any genetic variants with surrogate measures of insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity indexes in a subset of 2,662 control subjects.Compared with subjects carrying zero, one, or two risk alleles, each additional risk allele was associated with 17% increased risk, and there was an up to 3.3-fold increased risk for type 2 diabetes in those carrying eight or more risk alleles.Despite most of the effect sizes being similar between Asians and Europeans in the metaanalyses, the ethnic differences in risk allele frequencies in most of these genes lead to variable attributable risks in these two populations. CONCLUSIONS-Ourfindings support the important but differential contribution of these genetic variants to type 2 diabetes and obesity in Asians compared with Europeans.Diabetes 57: 2226-2233, 2008T ype 2 diabetes is a major health problem affecting more than 170 million people worldwide.In the next 20 years, Asia will be hit hardest, with the diabetic populations in India and China more than doubling (1).Type 2 diabetes is characterized by the presence of insulin resistance and pancreatic ␤-cell dysfunction, resulting from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors.Until recently, few genes identified through linkage scans or the candidate gene approach have been confirmed to be associated with type 2 diabetes (e.g., PPARG, KCNJ11, CAPN10, and TCF7L2).Under the common variant-common disease hypothesis, several genome-wide association (GWA) studies on type 2 diabetes have been conducted in large-scale case-control samples.Six novel genes (SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKAL1, CDKN2A and CDKN2B, IGF2BP2, and FTO) with modest effect for type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.14 -1.20) had been reproducibly demonstrated in multiple populations of European ancestry.Moreover, TCF7L2 was shown to have the largest effect for type 2 diabetes (1.37) in the European populations to date (2-8).Although many of these genes may be implicated in the insulin production/secretion pathway (TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, and IGF2BP2) (6,9 -11), FTO is associated with type 2 diabetes through its regulation of adiposity (8,12,13).Moreover, two adjacent regions near CDKN2A/B are associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases risks, respectively (7,14 -16).Despite the consistent associations among Europeans, the contributions of these genetic variants in other ethnic groups are less clear.Given the differences in environmental factors (e.g., lifestyle), risk factor profiles (body composition and insulin secretion/resistance patterns), and genetic background (linkage disequilibrium pattern and risk allele frequencies) between Europeans and Asians, it is important to understand the role of these genes in Asians.A recent case-control study in 1,728 Japanese subjects revealed nominal association to type 2 diabetes for variants at the SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKAL1, CDKN2B, and FTO genes but not IGF2BP2 (17).In the present large-scale case-control replication study of 6,719 Asians, we aimed to test for the association of six novel genes from GWA studies and TCF7L2, which had the largest effect in Europeans, and their joint effects on type 2 diabetes risk and metabolic traits. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSAll subjects were recruited from Hong Kong and Korea and of Asian ancestry.The subjects in the Hong Kong case-control study were of southern Han Chinese ancestry residing in Hong Kong.Participants for the case cohort consisting of 1,481 subjects with type 2 diabetes were selected from two"
