[6] reporting that b-cell mass (and insulin content) in people with Type 2 diabetes was on average ~35% lower than that of healthy control subjects.However, this difference was only ~24% within 5 years of diagnosis, far below levels likely to lead to the symptoms of diabetes.Indeed, given our present inability to monitor b-cell mass prospectively over the course of the disease, it is conceivable that the differences observed post mortem between healthy individuals and those with Type 2 diabetes [5,6] may reflect an increased predisposition to diabetes in those born with a lower than average b-cell mass."
