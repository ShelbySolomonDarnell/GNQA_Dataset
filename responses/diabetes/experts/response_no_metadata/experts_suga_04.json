Their annotated functions provide possible explanations of how the epigenetic dysregulation of these genes in diabetic islets is connected to T2D pathogenesis.Numerous genes that were identified by our methylation profiling approach have been functionally implicated in insulin secretion.Examination of the available literature on the function of these genes revealed three aspects of insulin secretion with which they interfere: some of these genes influence the expression of the insulin gene, like MAPK1 and SOX6, or its post-translational maturation, like PPP2R4 (cf. Figure 7 and references therein).Others can deregulate the process of insulin secretion itself (SLC25A5, Ahuja et al, 2007;RALGDS, Ljubicic et al, 2009) or influence synthesis as well as secretion (vitronectin, Kaido et al, 2006).A third group of differentially methylated genes affects (i) signalling processes in the b-cell leading to insulin secretion or (ii) glucose homeostasis in b-cells, thereby modulating insulin response upon stimulation.GRB10 (Yamamoto et al, 2008), FBP2 and HK1 (Figure 7) are examples for these genes.Additional genes found in our study have been implicated in the b-cells' capability to secrete insulin, though the mechanisms have not yet been fully established.The putative functions of these genes indicate a potential epigenetic impact on insulin secretion at multiple levels, namely signalling, expression/synthesis and secretion."
