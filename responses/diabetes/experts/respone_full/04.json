Their annotated functions provide possible explanations of how the epigenetic dysregulation of these genes in diabetic islets is connected to T2D pathogenesis.Numerous genes that were identified by our methylation profiling approach have been functionally implicated in insulin secretion.Examination of the available literature on the function of these genes revealed three aspects of insulin secretion with which they interfere: some of these genes influence the expression of the insulin gene, like MAPK1 and SOX6, or its post-translational maturation, like PPP2R4 (cf. Figure 7 and references therein).Others can deregulate the process of insulin secretion itself (SLC25A5, Ahuja et al, 2007;RALGDS, Ljubicic et al, 2009) or influence synthesis as well as secretion (vitronectin, Kaido et al, 2006).A third group of differentially methylated genes affects (i) signalling processes in the b-cell leading to insulin secretion or (ii) glucose homeostasis in b-cells, thereby modulating insulin response upon stimulation.GRB10 (Yamamoto et al, 2008), FBP2 and HK1 (Figure 7) are examples for these genes.Additional genes found in our study have been implicated in the b-cells' capability to secrete insulin, though the mechanisms have not yet been fully established.The putative functions of these genes indicate a potential epigenetic impact on insulin secretion at multiple levels, namely signalling, expression/synthesis and secretion."

Their annotated functions provide possible explanations of how the epigenetic dysregulation of these genes in diabetic islets is connected to T2D pathogenesis.Numerous genes that were identified by our methylation profiling approach have been functionally implicated in insulin secretion.Examination of the available literature on the function of these genes revealed three aspects of insulin secretion with which they interfere: some of these genes influence the expression of the insulin gene, like MAPK1 and SOX6, or its post-translational maturation, like PPP2R4 (cf. Figure 7 and references therein).Others can deregulate the process of insulin secretion itself (SLC25A5, Ahuja et al, 2007;RALGDS, Ljubicic et al, 2009) or influence synthesis as well as secretion (vitronectin, Kaido et al, 2006).A third group of differentially methylated genes affects (i) signalling processes in the b-cell leading to insulin secretion or (ii) glucose homeostasis in b-cells, thereby modulating insulin response upon stimulation.GRB10 (Yamamoto et al, 2008), FBP2 and HK1 (Figure 7) are examples for these genes.Additional genes found in our study have been implicated in the b-cells' capability to secrete insulin, though the mechanisms have not yet been fully established.The putative functions of these genes indicate a potential epigenetic impact on insulin secretion at multiple levels, namely signalling, expression/synthesis and secretion."

[10] did not identify a significant level of alteration in the IS-HD gene set (p ¼ 0.536), while DEA produced a comparably weak enrichment score (p ¼ 0.607).The failure to detect a significant transcriptional alteration in IS-HD may be explained by a number of factors.The enrichment results depended on the specific choice of the IS-HD gene set, and it is possible that an alternatively defined insulin-signaling gene set would be determined as significantly enriched.Additionally, expression changes in a few critical genes in IS-HD may be sufficient to substantially alter insulin signaling, and running DEA on the large IS-HD set may miss the contributions from these few genes."

Figure 9).While NIBAN protects against ER stress-induced apoptosis, CHAC1 seems to contribute to cell death.The hypomethylation observed at both genes could be explained by competing proapoptotic and antiapoptotic processes during ER stress response in diabetic islets.NIBAN is a negative regulator of translation initiation factor eIF2a (Sun et al, 2007).Therefore, its hypomethylation may indicate an attempt to re-establish ER homeostasis by reduction of protein synthesis (Eizirik et al, 2008).Pending the outcome of these attempts, ER stress-induced apoptosis may be triggered by CHAC1 and other proapoptotic genes."

Three cases with WFS1 mutations were sporadic; two of them were confirmed to be caused by a de novo mutation based on the genetic analysis of their parents.",
