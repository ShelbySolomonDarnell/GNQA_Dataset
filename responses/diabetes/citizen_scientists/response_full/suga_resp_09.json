Methods:We performed a genome-wide association study in 601 type 2 diabetes patients after stratifying them according to the presence or absence of four types of diabetes complications: diabetic neuropathy, diabetic nephropathy, macrovascular complications, and ophthalmic complications. Results:The analysis revealed ten novel associations showing genome-wide significance, including rs1132787 (GYPA, OR = 2.71; 95% CI = 2.02-3.64)and diabetic neuropathy, rs2477088 (PDE4DIP, OR = 2.50; 95% CI = 1.87-3.34),rs4852954 (NAT8, OR = 2.27; 95% CI = 2.71-3.01),rs6032 (F5, OR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.63-2.77),rs6935464 (RPS6KA2, OR = 2.25; 95% CI = 6.69-3.01)and macrovascular complications, rs3095447 (CCDC146, OR = 2.18; 95% CI = 1.66-2.87)and ophthalmic complications.By applying the targeted approach of previously reported susceptibility loci we managed to replicate three associations: MAPK14 (rs3761980, rs80028505) and diabetic neuropathy, APOL1 (rs136161) and diabetic nephropathy.Conclusions: Together these results provide further evidence for the implication of genetic factors in the development of type 2 diabetes complications and highlight several potential key loci, able to modify the risk of developing these conditions.Moreover, the candidate variant approach proves a strong and consistent effect for multiple variants across different populations."

                "text": "The future of type 1 diabetes genetics\n\nAfter more than two decades of work, type 1 diabetes is probably the best characterized of all common multigenic diseases.Thus far, the identified genetic risk factors have been plausible candidate genes with common variants that affect susceptibility.Of these, variation at HLA alone explains much of the risk to siblings (HLA provides a l s of 3.4 out of a total of 15, leaving a l s of 15/3.4 ¼ 4.4 to be explained), and INS and CTLA4 have also been identified as disease loci.What, then, is left to be done?First, many risk alleles remain undiscovered.Although their effect will be much weaker than is seen for HLA (and almost certainly weaker than for INS), they may identify genes or pathways that provide insight into etiology, pathogenesis, and perhaps even prevention or treatment.Each additional variant that is clearly proven to increase risk will also help to identify high-risk non-diabetic individuals who might participate in studies of prevention and, in turn, benefit from preventive interventions.These alleles might also be relevant to the genetics of diabetic complications (not discussed in this review), perhaps identifying patients who would benefit most from intensive treatment and monitoring."
