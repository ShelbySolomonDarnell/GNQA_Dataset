Certain genetic variants may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but this risk can be modified by environmental factors. For instance, the adverse effect of some T2D-associated genetic variants may be attenuated by higher physical activity levels or a healthy lifestyle. Conversely, low physical activity and dietary factors characterizing a Western dietary pattern may augment the risk. Understanding these interactions can help in the development of personalized prevention strategies and treatments for T2D.",

[31] generated a genetic risk score (GRS) using ten GWAS-identified SNPs and observed a significant interaction between the Western dietary pattern and GRS in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.The Western dietary pattern was only positively associated with risk of T2D among men with a high GRS, but not with low GRS subjects.Another large meta-analysis of 14 cohort studies [32] revealed that dietary whole-grain intake potentially interacted with one GCKR variant (rs780094) for fasting insulin in individuals of European descent.Greater whole-grain intake was associated with a smaller reduction of fasting insulin in individuals with the insulin-raising allele of rs780094, compared to the non-risk allele."

[31] generated a genetic risk score (GRS) using ten GWAS-identified SNPs and observed a significant interaction between the Western dietary pattern and GRS in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.The Western dietary pattern was only positively associated with risk of T2D among men with a high GRS, but not with low GRS subjects.Another large meta-analysis of 14 cohort studies [32] revealed that dietary whole-grain intake potentially interacted with one GCKR variant (rs780094) for fasting insulin in individuals of European descent.Greater whole-grain intake was associated with a smaller reduction of fasting insulin in individuals with the insulin-raising allele of rs780094, compared to the non-risk allele."

[4].Another variable that influences the statistical and real association of an SNP with a disease or response to a diet is epigenetic interaction.Epigenesis is the study of heritable changes in gene function that occur without a change in the DNA sequence, such as DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling.Both mechanisms can affect gene expression by altering the accessibility of DNA to regulatory proteins or complexes such as transcription factors, and they can be influenced by certain nutrients and by overall caloric intake.Thus, it can be expected that long-term exposure to certain diets could produce permanent epigenetic changes in the genome [7]."

MethodsWe genotyped 16 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and examined clinical factors in 16,061 Swedish and 2770 Finnish subjects.Type 2 diabetes developed in 2201 (11.7%) of these subjects during a median follow-up period of 23.5 years.We also studied the effect of genetic variants on changes in insulin secretion and action over time. ResultsStrong predictors of diabetes were a family history of the disease, an increased body-mass index, elevated liver-enzyme levels, current smoking status, and reduced measures of insulin secretion and action.Variants in 11 genes (TCF7L2, PPARG, FTO, KCNJ11, NOTCH2, WFS1, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, JAZF1, and HHEX) were significantly associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes independently of clinical risk factors; variants in 8 of these genes were associated with impaired beta-cell function.The addition of specific genetic information to clinical factors slightly improved the prediction of future diabetes, with a slight increase in the area under the receiveroperating-characteristic curve from 0.74 to 0.75; however, the magnitude of the increase was significant (P = 1.0×10 −4 ).The discriminative power of genetic risk factors improved with an increasing duration of follow-up, whereas that of clinical risk factors decreased. ConclusionsAs compared with clinical risk factors alone, common genetic variants associated with the risk of diabetes had a small effect on the ability to predict the future development of type 2 diabetes.The value of genetic factors increased with an increasing duration of follow-up."
