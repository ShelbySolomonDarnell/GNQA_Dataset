[109].Using a non-genetic diabetes mouse model (low dose of STZ combined to HF diet), this group showed that paternal diabetes did not alter body weight, fat mass, or energy intake in F1 offspring, but it induced fasting hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance and insulin insensitivity in the male offspring to an extent similar to that seen in their fathers.To determine the mechanisms of the glucose intolerance and insulin insensitivity observed in the F1 male offspring, Wei et al. performed genome-wide microarray analyses of their pancreatic islets.The expression of 402 genes was modified (97 up-regulated and 305 downregulated).A large proportion of these genes were related to insulin and glucose metabolism, including GTPase activity, GTP and ATP binding, sugar binding, and calcium binding.Wei et al. also found several differentially methylated loci in the F1 islets.The same group also asked whether the metabolic and epigenetic changes in the F1 generation can be passed to the next generation (F2 generation).For that purpose, they mated F1 diabetic males (F1-D) whose fathers were diabetic, with normal females, and then examined metabolic and epigenetic changes in their offspring (F2).The F2 generation also exhibited impaired glucose tolerance and decreased insulin sensitivity (but not fasting hyperglycemia).Examination of the methylation status for 10 regions distributed on different chromosomes that were most affected by paternal diabetes, showed that all of these regions were still significantly affected in the F2 generation.As the F1 animals received normal diet without any STZ treatment and their F2 offspring exhibited similar phenotypic and epigenetic changes, the observed effects of epigenetic inheritance are most likely attributable to the diabetes-associated physiological and metabolic conditions in F0 male founders."
