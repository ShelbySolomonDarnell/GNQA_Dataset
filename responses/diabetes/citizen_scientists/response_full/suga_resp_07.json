[49] identified five miRNAs (-192, -194, -204, -215, and -216) that were highly expressed in human and mouse kidney using miRNA microarray.A recent report using new proteomic approaches to profile and identify miRNA targets demonstrated that miR-NAs repress their targets at both the mRNA and translational levels and that the effects are mostly relatively mild [50].The role of miR-192 remains controversial and highlights the complex nature of miRNA research.Kato et al. [51] observed increased renal expression of miR-192 in streptozotocin-(STZ-) induced diabetes and in the db/db mouse and demonstrated that transforming growth factor (TGF-1) upregulated miR-192 in mesangial cells (MCs).miR-192 repressed the translation of Zeb2, a transcriptional repressor that binds to the E-box in the collagen 12 (col12) gene.They proposed that miR-192 repressed Zeb2 and resulted in increased col12 expression in vitro and contributed to increased collagen deposition in vivo.These data suggest a role for miR-192 in the development of the matrix accumulation observed in DN.It is interesting that the expression of miR-192 was increased by TGF- in mouse MCs (mesangial cells), whereas, conversely, the expression of its target, Zeb2, was decreased [51].This also paralleled the increased Col1 2 and TGF- expression [51].These results suggested that the increase in TGF- in vivo in diabetic glomeruli and in vitro in MCs can induce miR-192 expression, which can target and downregulate Zeb2 thereby to increase Col1 2.This is supported by the report showing that miR-192 is upregulated in human MCs treated with high glucose [51].TGF- induced downregulation of Zeb2 (via miR-192) and Zeb1 (via potentially another miRNA) can cooperate to enhance Col1 2 expression via de-repression at E-box elements [51].In contrast to the above, other reports suggest the relationship between miR-192 and renal fibrosis may be more complicated.Krupa et al. [52] identified two miRNAs in human renal biopsies, the expression of which differed by more than twofold between progressors and nonprogressors with respect to DN, the greatest change occurring in miR-192 which was significantly lower in patients with advanced DN, correlating with tubulointerstitial fibrosis and low glomerular filtration rate.They also reported, in contrast to the Kato et al. [51] study in MCs, that TGF-1 decreased expression of miR-192 in cultured proximal tubular cells (PTCs).These investigators concluded that a decrease in miR-192 is associated with increased renal fibrosis in vivo.Interestingly, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) treatment also resulted in fibrogenesis but caused the induction of miR-192/215 and, consequently, decreased Zeb2 and increased E-cadherin.The contrasting findings above highlight the complex nature of miRNA research.Some of the differences may relate to models and/or experimental conditions; however, one often overlooked explanation is that some effects of miRNAs and inhibitors are likely to be indirect in nature.A recent report also showed that BMP6-induced miR-192 decreases the expression of Zeb1 in breast cancer cells [53].Thus, TGF- induced increase in the expression of key miRNAs (miR-192 and miR-200 family members) might coordinately downregulate E-box repressors Zeb1 and Zeb2 to increase Col12 expression in MCs related to the pathogenesis of DN.The proximal promoter of the Col1a2 gene responds to TGF- via smads and SP1.Conversely, the downregulation of Zeb1 and Zeb2 by TGF- via miR-200 family and miR-192 can affect upstream E-box regions.Because E-boxes are present in the upstream genomic regions of the miR-200 family, miR-200 family members may themselves be regulated by Zeb1 and Zeb2 [54].It is possible that the miR-200 family upregulated by TGF- or in diabetic glomeruli under early stages of the disease can also regulate collagen expression related to diabetic kidney disease by targeting and downregulating E-box repressors.miR-192 might initiate signaling from TGF- to upregulate miR-200 family members, which subsequently could amplify the signaling by further regulating themselves through down regulation of Ebox repressors.Such events could lead to progressive renal dysfunction under pathologic conditions such as diabetes, in which TGF- levels are enhanced.Conversely, there are several reports that miR-200 family members and miR-192 can be suppressed by TGF-, and this promotes epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer and other kidneyderived epithelial cell lines via subsequent upregulation of targets Zeb1 and Zeb2 to repress E-cadherin [54,55]."

                "text": "Roles of lncRNAs in diabetic complications\n\nApart from being involved in major metabolic tissues during diabetes as discussed above, lncRNAs are implicated in complications associated with diabetes.Diabetic retinopathy is one of the common complications in diabetic patients, which leads to impaired or loss of vision.Altered expression of lncRNAs, namely MALAT1 [82,83] and MEG3 [84], are reported to be associated with diabetic retinopathy.In STZ-induced diabetic rats, the expression of MALAT1 is elevated in the endothelial cells of the retina and knockdown of MALAT1 ameliorates retinopathy in STZ-induced rats [82].The lncRNA, MEG3, was also found to be downregulated in the retina of STZ-induced diabetic mice and its in vitro knockdown in retinal endothelial cells was found to regulate cell proliferation, viability, and migration [84].Hyperglycemia as in diabetes causes upregulation of ANRIL levels in endothelial cells [85,86], and this elevates the levels of the PRC2 subunit, EZH2 that consequently promotes the expression of VEGF, a key promoter of angiogenesis [85].Another major complication associated with diabetes is diabetic nephropathy, and this is considered a major cause of end-stage renal disease and disability in diabetic patients [87].Recent studies show that lncRNAs play important roles in the development of diabetic nephropathy and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.There is higher expression of the lncRNA, PVT1, during diabetic nephropathy, and this increase leads to increased fibrosis due to accumulation of ECM proteins in renal cells [88]; downregulation of PVT1 reduces ECM accumulation [88].LncRNA PVT1 is also a host to miR-1207-5p and this miRNA is shown to regulate the expression of fibronectin1 (FN1), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI1), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) [89].In renal tube injury during diabetes, the lncRNA, MIAT, is under-expressed, and this negatively correlates with creatinine and BUN levels in the serum of these subjects.It has been shown to regulate cell viability of proximal convoluted renal tubules [90].In diabetic nephropathic mice, the lncRNA, MGC, is increased in renal mesangial cells.Interestingly, this lncRNA harbours a cluster of approximately 40 miRNAs, and is regulated by the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) [91].In CHOP -deficient mice, there is decreased expression of the lncRNA, MGC, and the clustered miRNAs, and these mice have shown an improvement in diabetic nephropathy [91].Diabetic nephropathy is also associated with increased levels of lincRNA, Gm4419, and this exerts its action by interacting with NF-κβ.Knockdown of this lincRNA in renal mesangial cells lowers cellular proliferation and inhibits expression of NF-κβ in hyperglycemic states [92].The lncRNA, TUG1, that is upregulated in diabetic nephropathy acts as sponge for miR-377 and regulates PPAR-γ expression which further modulates the expression of FN1, collagen type IV alpha 1 chain (COL4A1), PAI1, and TGFβ1 in renal mesangial cells [93].Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a critical end-stage complication associated with diabetes.Several such cardiovascular complications and myocardial dysfunction in diabetic patients lead to heart failure [94].Differential expression analysis in cardiac tissue from normal and diabetic rats shows that the lncRNA, MALAT1, is upregulated during cardiomyopathy and knockdown of this lncRNA improves left ventricular systolic function by reducing myocardial inflammation in diabetic rats [95,96].Decreased expression of the lncRNA, H19, is also reported during diabetes [68,70], and this often results in decreased expression of the exonic miRNA, miR-675 [97,98].mir-675 directly targets the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) which is involved in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in the cardiac tissue during diabetes.H19 overexpression in diabetic rats reduces oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation, and improves ventricle function [98].LncRNAs NONRATT021972 and uc.48+ are reported to be associated with diabetic neuropathic pain [99,100], and inhibition of both have been shown to alleviate such neuropathic pain by activating the P2X3 receptor.Impaired wound closure is a notable complication associated with diabetes and a recent report shows decreased levels of the lncRNA, Lethe in such impaired dorsal wounds of diabetic mice.This was demonstrated to be associated with increased ROS production, possibly through regulation of NOX2 expression [101]."

                "text": "miRNAs in Kidney Disease and Diabetic Nephropathy\n\nDiabetic nephropathy is a progressive kidney disease and a major debilitating complication of both type 1 and type 2  diabetes that can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and related cardiovascular disorders.Absence or lower levels of particular miRNAs in the kidney compared with other organs may permit renal specific expression of target proteins that are important for kidney functions [45].Figure 4 depicts the connection between the role of miRNAs and kidney fibrosis.Altered expression of miRNAs causes renal fibrosis by inducing EMT, EndMT, and other fibrogenic stimuli.The accumulative effects of hyperglycaemia, inflammatory cytokines, proteinuria, ageing, high blood pressure, and hypoxia result into alteration of miRNAs expression profiles.The altered miRNAs level causes the initiation of such transition program in normal kidney, finally fibrosis.Some of the miRNAs that are more abundant in the kidney compared with other organs include miR-192, miR-194, miR-204, miR-215, and miR-216.A critical role of miRNA regulation in the progression of glomerular and tubular damage and the development of proteinuria been suggested by studies in mice with podocytespecific deletion of Dicer [46].There was a rapid progression of renal disease with initial development of albuminuria followed by pathological features of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.It is likely that these phenotypes are due to the global loss of miRNAs because of Dicer deletion, but, given multiple miRNAs and their myriad targets, the precise pathways responsible require identification.These investigators also identified specific miRNA changes, for example, the downregulation of the miR-30 family when Dicer was deleted.Of relevance, the miR-30 family was found to target connective tissue growth factor, a profibrotic molecule that is also downstream of transforming growth factor (TGF)- [47].Thus, the targets of these miRNAs may regulate critical glomerular and podocyte functions.These findings have also been complemented by an elegant study revealing a developmental role for the miR-30 family during pronephric kidney development in Xenopus [48].Sun et al. [49] identified five miRNAs (-192, -194, -204, -215, and -216) that were highly expressed in human and mouse kidney using miRNA microarray.A recent report using new proteomic approaches to profile and identify miRNA targets demonstrated that miR-NAs repress their targets at both the mRNA and translational levels and that the effects are mostly relatively mild [50].The role of miR-192 remains controversial and highlights the complex nature of miRNA research.Kato et al. [51] observed increased renal expression of miR-192 in streptozotocin-(STZ-) induced diabetes and in the db/db mouse and demonstrated that transforming growth factor (TGF-1) upregulated miR-192 in mesangial cells (MCs).miR-192 repressed the translation of Zeb2, a transcriptional repressor that binds to the E-box in the collagen 12 (col12) gene.They proposed that miR-192 repressed Zeb2 and resulted in increased col12 expression in vitro and contributed to increased collagen deposition in vivo.These data suggest a role for miR-192 in the development of the matrix accumulation observed in DN.It is interesting that the expression of miR-192 was increased by TGF- in mouse MCs (mesangial cells), whereas, conversely, the expression of its target, Zeb2, was decreased [51].This also paralleled the increased Col1 2 and TGF- expression [51].These results suggested that the increase in TGF- in vivo in diabetic glomeruli and in vitro in MCs can induce miR-192 expression, which can target and downregulate Zeb2 thereby to increase Col1 2.This is supported by the report showing that miR-192 is upregulated in human MCs treated with high glucose [51].TGF- induced downregulation of Zeb2 (via miR-192) and Zeb1 (via potentially another miRNA) can cooperate to enhance Col1 2 expression via de-repression at E-box elements [51].In contrast to the above, other reports suggest the relationship between miR-192 and renal fibrosis may be more complicated.Krupa et al. [52] identified two miRNAs in human renal biopsies, the expression of which differed by more than twofold between progressors and nonprogressors with respect to DN, the greatest change occurring in miR-192 which was significantly lower in patients with advanced DN, correlating with tubulointerstitial fibrosis and low glomerular filtration rate.They also reported, in contrast to the Kato et al. [51] study in MCs, that TGF-1 decreased expression of miR-192 in cultured proximal tubular cells (PTCs).These investigators concluded that a decrease in miR-192 is associated with increased renal fibrosis in vivo.Interestingly, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) treatment also resulted in fibrogenesis but caused the induction of miR-192/215 and, consequently, decreased Zeb2 and increased E-cadherin.The contrasting findings above highlight the complex nature of miRNA research.Some of the differences may relate to models and/or experimental conditions; however, one often overlooked explanation is that some effects of miRNAs and inhibitors are likely to be indirect in nature.A recent report also showed that BMP6-induced miR-192 decreases the expression of Zeb1 in breast cancer cells [53].Thus, TGF- induced increase in the expression of key miRNAs (miR-192 and miR-200 family members) might coordinately downregulate E-box repressors Zeb1 and Zeb2 to increase Col12 expression in MCs related to the pathogenesis of DN.The proximal promoter of the Col1a2 gene responds to TGF- via smads and SP1.Conversely, the downregulation of Zeb1 and Zeb2 by TGF- via miR-200 family and miR-192 can affect upstream E-box regions.Because E-boxes are present in the upstream genomic regions of the miR-200 family, miR-200 family members may themselves be regulated by Zeb1 and Zeb2 [54].It is possible that the miR-200 family upregulated by TGF- or in diabetic glomeruli under early stages of the disease can also regulate collagen expression related to diabetic kidney disease by targeting and downregulating E-box repressors.miR-192 might initiate signaling from TGF- to upregulate miR-200 family members, which subsequently could amplify the signaling by further regulating themselves through down regulation of Ebox repressors.Such events could lead to progressive renal dysfunction under pathologic conditions such as diabetes, in which TGF- levels are enhanced.Conversely, there are several reports that miR-200 family members and miR-192 can be suppressed by TGF-, and this promotes epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer and other kidneyderived epithelial cell lines via subsequent upregulation of targets Zeb1 and Zeb2 to repress E-cadherin [54,55]."

Asb15 gene is the most up-regulated one we identified and confirmed.Asb15 is a member of Asb gene family; the family has been reported to be involved in cell proliferation and differentiation (Hancock et al., 1991;Kohroki et al., 2001;Liu et al., 2003).The presence of both Ankyrin repeat and suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) box motifs are characters of members of Asb gene family (McDaneld, Hancock, & Moody, 2004).Member of SOCS family plays important roles in the negative regulation of signaling pathways (Kile & Alexander, 2001;Zhang et al., 2001).SOCS3 acts as a regulator of inflammation through inhibiting JAK/STAT pathway (Tamiya, Kashiwagi, & Takahashi, 2011).Down-regulating SOCS3-STAT3 can alleviate DR (Chen, Lv, & Gan, 2017;Jiang, Thaksan, & Bheemreddy, 2014;Ye & Steinle, 2015).Ladinin-1(Lad1), a largely uncharacterized protein to date, was found to be related to the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells (Roth, Srivastava, & Lindzen, 2018).Cell proliferation and migration are processes of neovascularization.Neovascularization is the sign of PDR, which can lead to serious vision loss of patients.Fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2) is a member of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) family.FGFs and their receptors have important roles in cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival (Saichaemchan, Ariyawutyakorn, & Varella-Garcia, 2016).FGF2 was found overexpression in the early stage of DR, and it can destroy the blood-retinal barrier (Yang et al., 2018).Hemoglobin alpha adult chain 1 (Hba-a1) is one of the hemoglobin genes.Hemoglobin plays an important role in neuronal respiration, oxidative stress, and response to injury (He et al., 2010;Poh, Yeo, Stohler, & Ong, 2012;Richter, Meurers, Zhu, Medvedeva, & Chesselet, 2009).Neuronal respiration is an important life activity of neuronal cells.Neurological injury is one of the performances of DR.Inositol monophosphatase domain containing 1 (Impad1) encodes gPAPP, which is a Golgi-resident nucleotide phosphatase that hydrolyzes phosphoadenosine phosphate (PAP), the by-product of sulfotransferase reactions, to AMP.AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway plays vital roles in the diabetes-induced retinal inflammation (Kubota, Ozawa, & Kurihara, 2011).RT1-Bb, RT1-Ba, belongs to RT1 complex, which is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of rat (Eberhard & Lutz, 2001).It is believed that the MHC region is vital because it plays an important role in diseases, such as autoimmune and infectious diseases, vascular diseases like DR, hematological and neurological diseases (John, 2005).Collagen type III alpha 1 chain (Col3a1) is a kind of type III collagen, mainly existing in the extracellular matrix.Lacking of type III collagen can destroy the structure of connective tissues (Cortini et al., 2017).According to previous researches, it is associated with the aneurysm.Retinal microaneurysm is the early performance of DR.Col3a1 was also found significantly changed in RNA-seq of human PDR fibrovascular membranes (Lam et al., 2017).αA-crystallin (Cryga) and αF-crystallin (Crygf) are members of crystallins, which were involved in different functions in various tissues (Clayton, Jeanny, Bower, & Errington, 1986;Head, Peter, & Clayton, 1991;Smolich, Tarkington, Saha, & Grainger, 1994).Knockout of αA-crystallin can inhibit ocular neovascularization (Xu, Bai, & Huang, 2015).More and more evidence indicated that inflammation (Adamis, 2002;Gologorsky, Thanos, & Vavvas, 2012) and neovascularization (Gardner & Davila, 2017;Nguyen et al., 2018) are important in the pathogenesis of DR.The results of the KEGG pathway significant enrichment analysis revealed two most enrichment items-cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.CAMs are proteins located on cell surface; the binding of CAMs to their receptors is important in the mediation of inflammatory and immune reactions (Golias et al., 2007).Previous studies have suggested that CAMs are important in the development of DR (Khalfaoui et al., 2009;Ugurlu et al., 2013) of insulin and is associated with DR neovascularization (Qin, Zhang, & Xu, 2015;Sasore, Reynolds, & Kennedy, 2014)."
