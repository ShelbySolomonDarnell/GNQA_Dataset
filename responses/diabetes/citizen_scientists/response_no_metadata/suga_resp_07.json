[49] identified five miRNAs (-192, -194, -204, -215, and -216) that were highly expressed in human and mouse kidney using miRNA microarray.A recent report using new proteomic approaches to profile and identify miRNA targets demonstrated that miR-NAs repress their targets at both the mRNA and translational levels and that the effects are mostly relatively mild [50].The role of miR-192 remains controversial and highlights the complex nature of miRNA research.Kato et al. [51] observed increased renal expression of miR-192 in streptozotocin-(STZ-) induced diabetes and in the db/db mouse and demonstrated that transforming growth factor (TGF-1) upregulated miR-192 in mesangial cells (MCs).miR-192 repressed the translation of Zeb2, a transcriptional repressor that binds to the E-box in the collagen 12 (col12) gene.They proposed that miR-192 repressed Zeb2 and resulted in increased col12 expression in vitro and contributed to increased collagen deposition in vivo.These data suggest a role for miR-192 in the development of the matrix accumulation observed in DN.It is interesting that the expression of miR-192 was increased by TGF- in mouse MCs (mesangial cells), whereas, conversely, the expression of its target, Zeb2, was decreased [51].This also paralleled the increased Col1 2 and TGF- expression [51].These results suggested that the increase in TGF- in vivo in diabetic glomeruli and in vitro in MCs can induce miR-192 expression, which can target and downregulate Zeb2 thereby to increase Col1 2.This is supported by the report showing that miR-192 is upregulated in human MCs treated with high glucose [51].TGF- induced downregulation of Zeb2 (via miR-192) and Zeb1 (via potentially another miRNA) can cooperate to enhance Col1 2 expression via de-repression at E-box elements [51].In contrast to the above, other reports suggest the relationship between miR-192 and renal fibrosis may be more complicated.Krupa et al. [52] identified two miRNAs in human renal biopsies, the expression of which differed by more than twofold between progressors and nonprogressors with respect to DN, the greatest change occurring in miR-192 which was significantly lower in patients with advanced DN, correlating with tubulointerstitial fibrosis and low glomerular filtration rate.They also reported, in contrast to the Kato et al. [51] study in MCs, that TGF-1 decreased expression of miR-192 in cultured proximal tubular cells (PTCs).These investigators concluded that a decrease in miR-192 is associated with increased renal fibrosis in vivo.Interestingly, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) treatment also resulted in fibrogenesis but caused the induction of miR-192/215 and, consequently, decreased Zeb2 and increased E-cadherin.The contrasting findings above highlight the complex nature of miRNA research.Some of the differences may relate to models and/or experimental conditions; however, one often overlooked explanation is that some effects of miRNAs and inhibitors are likely to be indirect in nature.A recent report also showed that BMP6-induced miR-192 decreases the expression of Zeb1 in breast cancer cells [53].Thus, TGF- induced increase in the expression of key miRNAs (miR-192 and miR-200 family members) might coordinately downregulate E-box repressors Zeb1 and Zeb2 to increase Col12 expression in MCs related to the pathogenesis of DN.The proximal promoter of the Col1a2 gene responds to TGF- via smads and SP1.Conversely, the downregulation of Zeb1 and Zeb2 by TGF- via miR-200 family and miR-192 can affect upstream E-box regions.Because E-boxes are present in the upstream genomic regions of the miR-200 family, miR-200 family members may themselves be regulated by Zeb1 and Zeb2 [54].It is possible that the miR-200 family upregulated by TGF- or in diabetic glomeruli under early stages of the disease can also regulate collagen expression related to diabetic kidney disease by targeting and downregulating E-box repressors.miR-192 might initiate signaling from TGF- to upregulate miR-200 family members, which subsequently could amplify the signaling by further regulating themselves through down regulation of Ebox repressors.Such events could lead to progressive renal dysfunction under pathologic conditions such as diabetes, in which TGF- levels are enhanced.Conversely, there are several reports that miR-200 family members and miR-192 can be suppressed by TGF-, and this promotes epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer and other kidneyderived epithelial cell lines via subsequent upregulation of targets Zeb1 and Zeb2 to repress E-cadherin [54,55]."
