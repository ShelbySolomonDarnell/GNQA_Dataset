Certain genetic variants may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but this risk can be modified by environmental factors. For instance, the adverse effect of some T2D-associated genetic variants may be attenuated by higher physical activity levels or a healthy lifestyle. Conversely, low physical activity and dietary factors characterizing a Western dietary pattern may augment the risk. Understanding these interactions can help in the development of personalized prevention strategies and treatments for T2D.",

[31] generated a genetic risk score (GRS) using ten GWAS-identified SNPs and observed a significant interaction between the Western dietary pattern and GRS in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.The Western dietary pattern was only positively associated with risk of T2D among men with a high GRS, but not with low GRS subjects.Another large meta-analysis of 14 cohort studies [32] revealed that dietary whole-grain intake potentially interacted with one GCKR variant (rs780094) for fasting insulin in individuals of European descent.Greater whole-grain intake was associated with a smaller reduction of fasting insulin in individuals with the insulin-raising allele of rs780094, compared to the non-risk allele."
