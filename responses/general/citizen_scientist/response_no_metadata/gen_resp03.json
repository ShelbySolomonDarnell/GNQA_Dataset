This process typically involves mixing blood with lysis buffer and Proteinase K, followed by the addition of isopropanol and Inhibitor Removal Buffer. The DNA is then washed, centrifuged, and the supernatant discarded. The remaining pellet, which contains the purified genomic DNA, is diluted in TE buffer.\n\nFor plants, the mixed alkyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (MATAB) procedure can be used. This involves grinding plant material in liquid nitrogen, incubating it in extraction buffer, and then purifying it with chloroform:isoamylalcohol. The DNA extracts are then precipitated with isopropanol and resuspended in a buffer. The extracts are further purified on anion exchange columns.",
