This population can be a segregating population or a permanent population. The population is then genotyped using molecular markers. Next, the population is phenotyped for an interested trait. QTL analysis is then conducted using statistical procedures to find markers linked to the QTL. This involves single-marker regression across all chromosomes, where a hypothetical QTL is evaluated at the location of each marker locus. The significance of that QTL is estimated from a likelihood ratio statistic. A permutation test is then conducted to establish genome-wide significance criteria for the trait. The result is a list of marker loci that show a significant association with the trait. These loci are most likely to be near QTLs. The goal of QTL mapping is to identify regions of the genome that harbor genes relevant to a specified trait.",
