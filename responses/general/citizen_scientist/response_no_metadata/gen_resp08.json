This process involves meiosis, where each gamete (sperm and egg) contributes one chromosome to each pair, resulting in a zygote with a full complement of 23 chromosome pairs. The process of recombination or crossing over, where similar DNA sequences from the paired chromosomes swap genetic material, also plays a crucial role in determining the traits of the offspring. This results in a shuffling of genetic material and contributes to the genetic variation seen among offspring.",
