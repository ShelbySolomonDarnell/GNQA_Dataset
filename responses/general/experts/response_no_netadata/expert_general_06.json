RAD52 stimulates filament assembly (II).RAD51 has, like its Escherichia coli RecA counterpart, the ability to exchange the single strand with the same sequence from a double-stranded DNA molecule.Correct positioning of the sister chromatids by cohesins probably facilitates the identification of a homologous sequence.A candidate for the complex chromatin transactions associated with these DNA gymnastics is RAD54, a member of the SWI/SNF family of DNA-dependent ATPases.After identification of the identical sister chromatid sequence, the intact double-stranded copy is used as a template to properly heal the broken ends by DNA synthesis (III).Finally, the so-called Hollidayjunctions are resolved by resolvases 27,33,60 (IV).Homologous recombination involves the simultaneous action of large numbers of the same molecules, which are found to be concentrated in radiation-induced nuclear foci.These depend on, and also include, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins 36 .Recent evidence implicates BRCA2 directly or indirectly in nuclear translocation of RAD51 (ref.61)."

                    "text": "\n\nIn a previous study on the accumulation of spontaneous genome rearrangements in normal mice with aging, we discovered that 50% of the events were intrachromosomal, i.e., large deletions or inversions [22].In contrast, in this present study most of the rearrangements resulted from inter-chromosomal recombination, in both the Ercc1-mutant and control animals (Table 3).Previously, we used lacZ-plasmid line 60 mice with integration sites on Chromosomes 3 and 4, while in the present study line 30 mice were used with a single integration site on Chromosome 11.This indicates that the relative frequency of translocations is founder line specific and could be due to the position of the lacZ-plasmid cluster on the chromosome.Indeed, the chromosomal integration sites in line 60 mice are in the E1 region of Chromosome 3 (half way along the chromosome) and the C5 region of Chromosome 4 (two-thirds of the way along the chromosome) [22], while the integration site of founder line 30 (used in this study) is on the centromeric tip of Chromosome 11 (region A1-A2; not shown).The proximal location on Chromosome 11 prevents the detection of all but relatively small intra-chromosomal recombinations; larger events would lead to loss of the centromere and, therefore, the entire chromosome.If the orientation of the integration site in line 30, which is currently unknown, is towards the centromere, transpositions and inversions towards the distal end are the only detectable large intra-chromosomal rearrangements (for a detailed explanation of the different chromosomal events that can occur at the lacZ locus, see [22])."
