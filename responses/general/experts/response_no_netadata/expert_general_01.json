        "answer": "To determine which gene in your QTL is causal for the trait, you can follow several steps. First, narrow down the QTL interval to a reasonable size. Then, sort through the genes within the interval to identify potential Quantitative Trait Genes (QTGs). This can be challenging as more than one gene may be involved and the function of some genes may be unknown. You can use techniques like LCMS to establish causal relationships between DNA loci and transcripts. Once potential QTGs are identified, you need to prove that a particular gene is involved in the quantitative trait under study. This can be done by complementation of a QTL, which can be achieved in several ways. You can also use mediation analysis to identify the causal gene between the genetic variant and the trait-of-interest. Finally, investigate whether the expression of these genes correlates with the phenotype(s) of interest. If the gene expression strongly correlates with the QTL phenotype, this further strengthens the assumption that this gene might be causal.",
