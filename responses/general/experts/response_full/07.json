(1) and Watters et al. (8)  in this issue].These mouse initiatives demonstrate a viable, cost-effective alternative to human research requiring family studies, population linkage analysis, or genome-wide genotyping on a multitude of individuals for association mapping."

(1) and Watters et al. (8)  in this issue].These mouse initiatives demonstrate a viable, cost-effective alternative to human research requiring family studies, population linkage analysis, or genome-wide genotyping on a multitude of individuals for association mapping."
