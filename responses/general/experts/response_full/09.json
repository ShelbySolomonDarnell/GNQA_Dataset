This uniparental transmission of mtDNA is ensured by complex mechanisms that eliminate paternal mitochondria from sperm during fertilization. mtDNA also exhibits a higher mutation rate than nuclear DNA, leading to significant population-level mtDNA polymorphisms. These polymorphisms can be clustered into distinct haplogroups that represent major branch points on the mitochondrial phylogenetic tree. In contrast, nuclear DNA undergoes bi-parental recombination.",

[330], and the notion that mtDNA mutagenesis played a role in aging took hold.The phenotypical importance of mutations in mtDNA was demonstrated by Wallace et al. [331] and Holt et al. [332], who first showed that Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and mitochondrial myopathies were caused by mtDNA mutations (reviewed in [333]).Because mtDNA is so close to the site of mitochondrial ROS production, it is exposed to considerably higher oxidative stress, resulting in 3-fold higher levels of DNA oxidative damage (the previously quoted 20-fold figure is apparently due to an isolation artifact [334,335]).In the 1990s a series of papers reported that the frequency of mitochondrial DNA deletions increases dramatically with age, being essentially undetectable in young individuals and reaching levels as high as 2% of mtDNA in old individuals.This age-related increase in mtDNA deletions was found in organisms as diverse as worms, mice, and humans (reviewed in [24,336]).The same is also true with mtDNA point mutations [337,338].Certain mtDNA polymorphisms have been found in increased frequency in centenarians, implying a protective effect during aging [339][340][341].Similar protective effects of mtDNA polymorphisms have been reported for the age-related neurodegenerative condition, Parkinson's disease [342]."

( 2) Second, we expand our mitochondrial genomics dataset to quantify mtDNA genetic structure across the landscape and test whether mtDNA haplotypes, and alleles at a nonsynonymous SNP in the Cytochrome B (CytB) gene correlate with aging ecotypes. (3) Third, we test the hypothesis that variation in mtDNA correlates with whole-organism variation in metabolic rates, suggesting a pathway linking mitochondrial genetic variation in mtDNA to whole-organism energetics.We first test whether different haplotypes differ in resting metabolic rate.Then, we test the effects of the nonsynonymous SNP in CytB on resting metabolic rate.The CytB gene encodes a component of complex III of the ETC, and was previously found to segregate between these life-history ecotypes (Schwartz et al., 2015).This SNP results in an amino acid substitution from isoleucine (aliphatic, hydrophobic) to threonine (hydrophilic) on a region that comes into close contact with a nuclear-encoded subunit (Schwartz et al., 2015).We combine previously published and new data on whole-organism resting metabolic rates (oxygen consumption) to test for the effects of this nonsynonymous mutation in three populations where we find heterogeneity at this nucleotide, thus allowing us to disentangle the effects of shared environment (population) from sequence variation (SNP).We predict that this SNP will correlate with variation in whole-organism metabolic rate, demonstrating a putatively adaptive difference between the derived and ancestral sequence.By utilizing this integrative data setfrom genes to organelles to whole organisms to populationsin a known life-history context, we are able to test hypotheses across levels of organization to provide a more complete picture of the complicated story of mitochondria and life history (Havird et al., 2019)."

( 2) Second, we expand our mitochondrial genomics dataset to quantify mtDNA genetic structure across the landscape and test whether mtDNA haplotypes, and alleles at a nonsynonymous SNP in the Cytochrome B (CytB) gene correlate with aging ecotypes. (3) Third, we test the hypothesis that variation in mtDNA correlates with whole-organism variation in metabolic rates, suggesting a pathway linking mitochondrial genetic variation in mtDNA to whole-organism energetics.We first test whether different haplotypes differ in resting metabolic rate.Then, we test the effects of the nonsynonymous SNP in CytB on resting metabolic rate.The CytB gene encodes a component of complex III of the ETC, and was previously found to segregate between these life-history ecotypes (Schwartz et al., 2015).This SNP results in an amino acid substitution from isoleucine (aliphatic, hydrophobic) to threonine (hydrophilic) on a region that comes into close contact with a nuclear-encoded subunit (Schwartz et al., 2015).We combine previously published and new data on whole-organism resting metabolic rates (oxygen consumption) to test for the effects of this nonsynonymous mutation in three populations where we find heterogeneity at this nucleotide, thus allowing us to disentangle the effects of shared environment (population) from sequence variation (SNP).We predict that this SNP will correlate with variation in whole-organism metabolic rate, demonstrating a putatively adaptive difference between the derived and ancestral sequence.By utilizing this integrative data setfrom genes to organelles to whole organisms to populationsin a known life-history context, we are able to test hypotheses across levels of organization to provide a more complete picture of the complicated story of mitochondria and life history (Havird et al., 2019)."

These results demonstrate that Irc3 is a mitochondrial branch migration enzyme.",
