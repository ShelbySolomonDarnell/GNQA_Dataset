RAD52 stimulates filament assembly (II).RAD51 has, like its Escherichia coli RecA counterpart, the ability to exchange the single strand with the same sequence from a double-stranded DNA molecule.Correct positioning of the sister chromatids by cohesins probably facilitates the identification of a homologous sequence.A candidate for the complex chromatin transactions associated with these DNA gymnastics is RAD54, a member of the SWI/SNF family of DNA-dependent ATPases.After identification of the identical sister chromatid sequence, the intact double-stranded copy is used as a template to properly heal the broken ends by DNA synthesis (III).Finally, the so-called Hollidayjunctions are resolved by resolvases 27,33,60 (IV).Homologous recombination involves the simultaneous action of large numbers of the same molecules, which are found to be concentrated in radiation-induced nuclear foci.These depend on, and also include, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins 36 .Recent evidence implicates BRCA2 directly or indirectly in nuclear translocation of RAD51 (ref.61)."

Finally, there are two blocks of a novel 138-bp tandem repeat, ACRO138, present within the DJ."

                "text": "\n\nThe conservation of DJ sequence between the five human acrocentric chromosomes provides a unique opportunity to visualize NORs by FISH.Whereas the rDNA content of NORs can vary greatly, probing of human metaphase chromosome spreads with a DJ BAC results in signal that is consistent between NORs (Floutsakou et al. 2013).Using this probing scheme, it was observed that in most human cell lines analyzed, including multiple primary lines, at least one and sometimes as many as four of the NORs present have very little or no detectable rDNA (C van Vuuren and B McStay, unpubl. ).Many studies have used silver staining of metaphase spreads prepared from stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes to determine how many NORs are active in normal human cells.The number of active NORs ranges from seven to 10, with an average of eight (Heliot et al. 2000).Possibly, NORs with low rDNA content are active but fall below a detection threshold in silver staining.At this point, it is worth considering the distribution of active versus silent rDNA repeats in humans and other mammals.If 50% of rDNA repeats are truly repressed, there are insufficient \"silent\" NORs to house them.We must conclude that active NORs are a mosaic of active and silent repeats."
