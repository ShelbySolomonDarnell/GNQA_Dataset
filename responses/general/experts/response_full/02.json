                "text": "Introduction\n\nHuman conceptions are afflicted by an extraordinary rate of chromosome errors, and the majority derive from the oocyte (Hassold and Hunt, 2001).In natural conceptions that reach clinical recognition, 35% of human pregnancies are aneuploid.The rate observed in preimplantation embryos is substantially higher, in part because aneuploid embryos have poor developmental potential and are selected against during the peri-implantation stages and throughout foetal life (Capalbo et al., 2014).In natural conception, more than 90% are of meiotic origin and the majority are caused by errors in meiosis I (Hassold and Hunt, 2001;Gabriel et al., 2011).In reproductive aged women, 20-30% of occytes (and up to 70% of oocytes in advanced maternal age (AMA) women) are aneuploid, while just 1-8% of spermatozoa are afflicted (Lu et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2012).In sperm, the incidence of aneuploidy is independent of paternal age (Erickson, 1978;Hassold and Hunt, 2001;Lu et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2012).The analyses of aneuploidy in miscarriages have been invaluable for our appreciation of the serious consequences chromosomal imbalances have for embryonic and foetal development, since a much higher incidence and wider range and representation of chromosomes are detected compared to subsequent developmental stages, including live births (Hassold et al., 1980;Zaragoza et al., 1994)."

                "text": "\n\nAnalogous to the post-natal occurrence of somatic mutations, we previously demonstrated a similar phenomenon, termed selfish spermatogonial selection, that occurs in the testes of adult men as they age.However, because the testis contains germ cells that, upon fertilization, will carry the genetic information across generations, this process has important reproductive implications, being associated with an increased prevalence of pathogenic DNMs in the next generation.Despite the relatively low average human germline point mutation rate of ∼1.2 × 10 −8 per nucleotide per generation (Kong et al. 2012;Goldmann et al. 2016;Jonsson et al. 2017), specific \"selfish\" DNMs in FGFR2, FGFR3, HRAS, PTPN11, and RET are observed up to 1000-fold more frequently in offspring (Goriely and Wilkie 2012).These pathogenic mutations, which cause developmental disorders that show an extreme paternal bias in origin and an epidemiological paternal age-effect (collectively referred to as PAE disorders; e.g., achondroplasia; Apert, Costello, and Noonan syndromes; multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2a/b), are identical (or allelic) to oncogenic driver mutations in tumors (Goriely and Wilkie 2012).We have proposed that although they arise at the normal background rate in male germline stem cells (spermatogonia), selfish mutations alter the behavior of spermatogonia within the testis.In a process akin to oncogenesis, these gain-of-function mutations provide a selective advantage that may involve increasing the rate of symmetrical divisions of the mutant spermatogonia (Qin et al. 2007;Choi et al. 2008Choi et al. , 2012;;Giannoulatou et al. 2013;Yoon et al. 2013;Martin et al. 2014), leading to their clonal expansion over time, which results in increased apparent mutation levels in sperm with age (Goriely and Wilkie 2012;Maher et al. 2014)."
