(i) It is a larger web resource than T1Dbase and integrates data from a wide range of biological research sources into its database.Therefore, available information is quite comprehensive. (ii) Genic positions for 99% of the variants obtained from T1Dbase could be retrieved. (iii) Ensembl contains quality checks for genetic variants in its variation pipeline.A variant is flagged as failed if certain quality criteria are not met, for instance if none of the variant alleles match the reference allele of the variant.Generally, Ensembl was found to give more detailed information regarding the genic positions of variants compared to T1Dbase."
