M. Green, 2008).Test results provide potential parents with information that may lead to decisions involving intervention in the genetic makeup of future children.Although some families welcome such options, others may be unable or unwilling to consider such procedures, due to fi nancial concerns or moral/ethical/religious beliefs."

(2008) found American couples less inclined to involve extended relatives in the prenatal decision-making process than Native Palestinian couples.Both of these examples clearly indicate that cultural differences can impact the ways in which families negotiate prenatal decisions.Further research needs to investigate how different families engage in such discussions and decision-making processes, especially as prenatal testing becomes more common and better able to predict or prevent a wider range of genetic conditions.Tightly closed ethnic groups remain at high risk of serving as carriers for genetic mutations, but the management of this possibility varies greatly.For example, some Ashkenazi Jewish groups use screening for mutations for Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) as the basis for rabbinical marriage advice; whereas, children born to Amish families in Pennsylvania more often present with glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1) but, given their beliefs, parents tend not to accept prenatal testing because of the implication of abortion (McKusick, 2000)."
