This process begins with the separation of the two strands of the mother cell DNA. New nucleotides are then assembled to form two double helices identical to the original one. This is facilitated by the base pairing rules where adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T) and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G). This ensures that each daughter cell receives an exact copy of the DNA. The replication process is crucial during cell division as it allows for the accurate transmission of genetic information from one generation of cells to the next.","weight":-1,"task_id":"3F9EDFE9A0222EA70459EC8985F134C4"},

First, a population is developed for genetic mapping. This population can be a segregating population or a permanent population. The population is then genotyped using molecular markers. Next, the population is phenotyped for an interested trait. QTL analysis is then conducted using statistical procedures to find markers linked to the QTL. This involves single-marker regression across all chromosomes, where a hypothetical QTL is evaluated at the location of each marker locus. The significance of that QTL is estimated from a likelihood ratio statistic. A permutation test is then conducted to establish genome-wide significance criteria for the trait. The result is a list of marker loci that show a significant association with the trait. These loci are most likely to be near QTLs.
